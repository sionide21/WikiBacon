      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7608">'''Mac Wellman''' (born 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], [[author]], and [[poet]]. Wellman is best known for his experimental work in the theater which rebels against theatrical conventions, often abandoning such traditional elements as plot and character altogether. His plays frequently resemble a moving collage of events which has more in common with an avant-garde dance production than Broadway-style theater. Wellman has stated, “More and more I think all theater is site-specific. When plays work, they work in the space.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnetiaux|first=Trish|title=Mac Wellman Explains, Or Doesn’t Explain, What Is Near And What Is Far|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2011/10/theater/mac-wellman-explains-or-doesnt-explain-what-is-near-and-what-is-far|publisher=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=08/1/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Helen Shaw writes, “Since a 1984 essay, ‘The Theatre of Good Intentions,’ [Wellman] has been the cynosure in a heaven full of experimental playwrights who rail against what Jonathan Lear, in his book ''Open Minded'', called a ‘tyranny’ of ‘the already known’” (vii).&lt;ref&gt;Helen Shaw. “Mac Wellman and Things of the Devil.” ''The Difficulty of Crossing a Field.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008. vii-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing his style with ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Wellman said that he uses words as objects in his writing. &quot;I found if you try to write totally in cliches and things that don't sound right,&quot; Wellman clarified, &quot;you deal with a language that frankly is 98% of what people speak, think, and hear. So it's enormously enjoyable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yablonsky, Linda. [http://bombsite.com/issues/53/articles/1908 &quot;Mac Wellman&quot;]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Fall 1995. Retrieved 27 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of language has been positively characterized as &quot;an untrammeled flow of logorrhea: plain words, fancy words, space-age words, Victorian words and words that defy the dictionary&quot; by ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Ben Brantley]].&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9C02EFD61238F933A15756C0A962958260 &quot;Review/Theater; Family Life Colored by Meance&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 20 May 1994. Retrieved 27 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of production, Wellman experiments with stage direction. Some directions are spoken and others are not, blurring the line between action and direction. Wellman notes, “That’s something I’m really interested in. I like it when people talk about what’s going on in a play. Sometimes it’s more interesting than trying to enact everything.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnetiaux|first=Trish|title=Mac Wellman Explains, Or Doesn’t Explain, What Is Near And What Is Far|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2011/10/theater/mac-wellman-explains-or-doesnt-explain-what-is-near-and-what-is-far|publisher=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=08/1/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Professional Credits==
Wellman is the Donald I. Fine Professor of Play Writing at [[Brooklyn College]], [[New York City]], and in 2010 he became a CUNY Distinguished Professor. Wellman is author to more than forty plays, including ''Harm's Way'' (1978), ''The Self-Begotten'' (1982), ''The Bad Infinity'' (1983), ''Dracula'' (1987), ''Whirligig'' (1988), ''Crowbar'' (1989), ''7 Blowjobs'' (1991), ''Terminal Hip'' (1984), ''Murder of Crows'' and ''Description Beggared or the Allegory of WHITENESS'' (2000). In 2006 he collaborated with [[Bang on a Can]] composer [[David Lang]] on the opera ''The Difficulty of Crossing a Field'', adapted from a very short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walat|first=Kathryn|title=In Dialogue: Mac Makes an Opera|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|year=2006|month=September|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/09/theater/mac-makes-an-opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has received grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], New York Foundation for the Arts, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the McKnight Foundation and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. In 1990 he received an [[Obie award]] for Best New American Play (for ''Bad Penny'', ''Terminal Hip'', and ''Crowbar''). In 1991 he received another Obie award for ''Sincerity Forever''. He has received a Lila Wallace-Readers’ Digest Writers Award, and most recently the 2003 [[Obie award]] for Lifetime Achievement as well as a grant from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] that same year. He is a co-founder of [[The Flea Theater]] in New York City.

'''Pamela Isaacs''' is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]] and [[actress]].

==Theatre==
In 1987 Isaacs appeared in ''Conrack'', a musical based on Pat Conroy's novel ''The River Is Wide,'' at AMAS Repertory Theater.&lt;ref name=PCOLConrack/&gt; The show is set in 1969 and recounts the adventures of Pat Conroy, a young white teacher who teaches black children on the remote South Carolina island of Yamacraw.&lt;ref name=PCOLConrack/&gt; Isaacs played Dr. Jackie Brooks, a black representative of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare who becomes romantically involved with Conroy.&lt;ref name=PCOLConrack/&gt; Stephen Holden in his review of the show for the New York Times said that Isaacs &quot;brings a fine psychological precison [sic] to the role of Dr. Jackie Brooks.&quot;&lt;ref name=PCOLConrack&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DB1330F936A35752C1A961948260  New York Times.  &quot; The Stage: 'Conrack,' a Musical&quot; by Stephen Holden.  November 5, 1987.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Isaacs replaced LaTonya Sue Welch, as Effie in Michael Bennett's production of ''Dreamgirls'' at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York. Alvin Klein of the New York Times said that &quot;Isaacs is so fine as that replacement that one feels a strange sense of confused priorities.&quot;&lt;ref name=PCOLDreamgirls&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1E3FF93BA2575AC0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print New York Times.  &quot;A Small 'Dreamgirls' On Stage in Elmsford&quot; by Alvin Klein.  September 18, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Isaacs played the title role of Kay Jones, a music-hall performer who wears several disguises, in the Goodspeed Opera House revival of the Gershwins' ''Oh, Kay!''.&lt;ref name=PCOLOhkay/&gt;  The setting in the revival was moved from Long Island to Harlem and the production was given an all-black cast.&lt;ref name=PCOLOhkay/&gt; Stephen Holden said in his review in the New York Times that &quot;Pamela Isaacs has only to raise an eyebrow to strike sparks. Her brassy comic charisma recalls [[Patti LuPone]] as Reno Sweeney in the Lincoln Center Theater production of ''[[Anything Goes]].''&quot;&lt;ref name=PCOLOhkay&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81330F932A35752C1A96F948260  New York Times.  &quot;A Gershwin-Wodehouse Spoof of Prohibition&quot; by Stephen Holden.  November 1, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Isaacs performed a one-woman show at Center Stage in Baltimore, appearing as Billie Holiday in &quot;Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill.&lt;ref name=PCOLLadyday&gt;Baltimore Sun.  &quot;Behind the scenes with Center Stage's production photographer&quot; by J. Wynn Rousuck.  December 4, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Wynn Rousuck called Isaacs a &quot;spellbinding performer&quot; in the production and added &quot;It's not that she attempts to impersonate [Billie Holiday]. That would probably be futile. Instead, Isaacs acts like Billie Holiday and sings like, well, Isaacs, who is a thrill to hear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore Sun.  &quot;Lady Day': Table-hopping at the cabaret&quot; by J.

May 9, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Isaacs returned to Baltimore's Center Stage to play the leading role  in a production of Kurt Weill's Happy End as Salvation Army worker Lilian Holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0410564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Baltimore for the Center Stage productions, Isaacs appeared in one episode of &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0410564/ The Internet Movie Database.  &quot;Pamela Isaacs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Nomination in ''The Life''===
In 1997 Isaacs played Queen, a principled prostitute who wants a real home and a marriage, in the musical ''[[The Life (musical)|The Life]]''. The New York Times said that &quot;Isaacs's voice has the suppleness of Lena Horne's and a purity that is never sabotaged by its range. It's an instrument to cause goose bumps of pleasure. She rivets attention from her first appearance until the ambitious finale. As sung by Ms. Isaacs, Queen has backbone that only a good score can express with such immediacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E7D9113AF936A35753C1A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print New York Times.  &quot;Why Whisper About It? 'The Life' Is a Joy&quot; by Vincent Canby.  October 5, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt; Isaacs was nominated for the 1997 [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Drama Desk Award]] as Best Actress in a Musical for ''[[The Life (musical)|The Life]]''. Ben Brantley also praised Isaac's performance when the play opened in 1997.&lt;ref name=PCOLBrantley/&gt; &quot;Most of the ballads go to Ms. Isaacs, who has a husky, vibrato-shaded voice, somewhere between Tina Turner and Helen Morgan, which resonates affectingly with pain and longing,&quot; said Brantley.&lt;ref name=PCOLBrantley/&gt; &quot;She delivers absolutely everything (including some clunky sung recitative) with commanding sincerity and polish.&quot;&lt;ref name=PCOLBrantley&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D81431F93BA15757C0A961958260 New York Times.  &quot; Lively Women, but Very Tired&quot; by Ben Brantley.  April 28, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Life played for 466 performances on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tams-witmark.com/musicals/thelife.html Tams-Witmakr.  &quot;The Life&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Isaacs works a plastic-molding machine in the revival of ''Working'' based on Studs Terkel's identically titled book, a compilation of verbatim interviews with dozens of workers about their daily toils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6DC1031F931A15750C0A96F958260 New York Times.  &quot;Angst of Working Stiffs From Mason to Waitress&quot; by Peter Marks.  March 22, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Isaacs plays a Starbucks counter girl who keeps the yuppies waiting in ''[[Newyorkers]]''.&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorkers/&gt; Isaacs' big number is ''No Hurry at All,'' &quot;a bluesy solo powerfully sung and amusingly acted&quot; said Bruce Weber in the New York Times.&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorkers&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E7D61E3CF93BA15750C0A9679C8B63 New York Times.  &quot;A Torch Song by Miss Liberty? O.K.&quot; by Bruce Weber.  March 28, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Isaacs won an [[Obie Award]] for her performance as the [[Starbucks]] [[barista]] in the [[off-Broadway]] play.

===Thoroughly Modern Millie===

In 2003 Isaacs won raves for her performance of Muzzie Van Hossmere, a madcap Manhattan cabaret singer and heiress with a zest for the high life and a glamorous penthouse, in the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Thoroughly Modern Millie (musical)|Thoroughly Modern Millie]]. Donna Bailey-Thompson said of Isaac's performance at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut that &quot;Pamela Isaacs almost stops the show when she wraps her powerful, throaty voice around an okay sound and transforms it into a throbbing paean to New York.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frugalfun.com/modern-millie.html Frugal Fun.  &quot;&quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; in Hartford until Sept 7 2003&quot; by Donna Bailey-Thompson.  September 2, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; D. Aviva Rothschild wrote of her performance: &quot;Pamela Isaacs as Muzzy proved right from the get-go why she'd been a Tony nominee for The Life.

Aviva Rothschild.  2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Les Spindle wrote that &quot;As bon-vivant millionaire Muzzy van Hossmere - a role created for Carol Channing - the vivacious Pamela Isaacs pulls off a tour-de-force triumph, bolstered by her lively new songs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4390310-1.html Back Stage West.  &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; by Les Spindle.

In 2006, Ma-Yi Theater Company's production of Warren Leight's ''No Foreigners Beyond This Point'' received a Drama Desk nomination for Best Play.  In 2010, Ma-Yi Theater received a Special Drama Desk Award for Excellence.  

''Savage Stage: Plays by Ma-Yi Theater Company'' is an anthology of selected new works developed and produced by the company since its founding.   Edited by Ma-Yi's Literary Manager, Joi Barrios, &quot;Savage Stage&quot; was published in 2007. 

Ma-Yi Theater Company is a participant in &quot;Artography: Arts in a Changing America&quot;, a pilot program launched by LINC (Leveraging Investments In Creativity) that seeks to map new arts practices in the United States resulting from demographic shifts.

== History ==

Ma-Yi did not start out to be an [[Asian American theatre]] company.  Founded in 1989 by [[Chito Jao Garces]] (artistic director), [[Ralph Pena]], [[Margot Lloren]], [[Ankie Frilles]], [[Luz de Leon]], [[Isolda Oca]], [[Arianne Recto]], [[Cristina Sison]], and [[Bernie Villanueva]], its first productions were [[Filipino culture|Filipino]], [[Filipino-American]] plays, or adaptations.  Also instrumental in the founding of Ma-Yi was [[Chris Millado]], who served as advisor to their first performance and returned to write and direct for the group.  Jorge Ortoll joined the company a year later in 1990, and became its executive director in 1991, the same year that Ma-Yi became a non-profit company and established a Board of Directors.  Ralph Peña and [[Betty Mae Piccio]] became co-artistic directors in 1995, and when Piccio moved to Philadelphia in 1996, Peña became its sole artistic director.  Ortoll and Peña have, since then, organized a support staff that has included Lourdes Obillo as accountant, Vince Hokia as technical director, Daniel Rech as marketing manager, and Andrew Eisenmann and Suzette Porte as associate artistic directors. 

For the past fifteen years since its inception, Ma-Yi has also benefited from the involvement of Filipino theatre artists based in New York – production designer and director Loy Arcenas, composer Fabian Obispo, veteran actors Ching Valdez-Aran and Mia Katigbak, and novelist and playwright [[Jessica Hagedorn]].  Other Filipino artists and writers have also been involved with Ma-Yi: director Behn Cervantes, playwright and actor Rody Vera, and playwright Marina Feleo-Gonzalez; [[National Artist of the Philippines]] for Literature [[Bienvenido Lumbera]] and Virgilio Almario, scholars Preachy Legasto, [[Nicanor Tiongson]], and Roland Tolentino, and choreographer-dancer Potri Rangkamanis.  In 2003, while in the United States as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the [[University of California Irvine]], Joi Barrios joined the group as its Literary Manager.  

In 1998, Ma-Yi Theater expanded its mission to include works by other, non-Filipino, Asian American writers.  This move was largely prodded by the company's recognition of the need for more developmental venues for new Asian American plays.  

Some of Ma-Yi Theater's recent productions include:  ''Sides: The Fear is Real'', ''The Romance of Magno Rubio'' (Obie Award), ''No Foreigners Beyond This Point'' (Drama Desk Nomination), and ''Trial By Water''.

The Ma-Yi Writers Lab was founded in 2004 by [[Sung Rno]] in connection with the TCG/NEA Playwright's Residence Program, and is currently led by Co-Directors [[Michael Lew]] and [[Rehana Lew Mirza]].  The Lab is Ma-Yi's resident company of emerging professional writers, and represents the largest group of professional Asian American playwrights ever assembled.

In 2005, the Ma-Yi Theater was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

'''Jason Nelson Robards, Jr.''' (July 26, 1922 – December 26, 2000) was an American actor on stage, and in film and television.  He is a winner of the [[Tony Award]],  two [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Emmy Award]]. He was also a [[United States Navy]] [[combat]] [[veteran]] of [[World War II]].  

He became famous playing works of [[Eugene O'Neill]], an American playwright, and regularly performed in O'Neill's works throughout his career.  Robards was cast in both common-man roles and as well-known historical figures.

==Early life and education==
Robards was born and raised in [[Chicago]], the son of Hope Maxine (née Glanville) Robards and [[Jason Robards, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dgmweb.net/genealogy/FGS/R/RobardsJasonNelson-HopeMaxineGlanville-AgnesE_.shtml ''Jason Robards genealogy''].&lt;/ref&gt; an actor who regularly appeared on the stage and in such early films as ''[[The Gamblers (1929 film)|The Gamblers]]'' (1929). Robards was of English, Welsh, Irish, and Swedish descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70717F8385F107A93C2AB178AD85F408785F9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0F3EB12656F62&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[New York City]], [[New York]], when Jason Jr. was still a toddler, and then moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], when he was six years old. Later interviews with Robards suggested that the trauma of his parents' divorce, which occurred during his grade-school years, greatly affected his personality and worldview. 

As a youth, Robards also witnessed first-hand the decline of his father's acting career. The elder Robards had enjoyed considerable success during the era of [[silent films]], but he fell out of favor after the advent of &quot;talkies&quot; ([[sound film]]), leaving the younger Robards soured on the Hollywood film industry. 

The teenaged Robards excelled in athletics, running a 4:18 mile during his junior year at [[Hollywood High School]] in Los Angeles. Although his prowess in sports attracted interest from several universities, upon his graduation in 1940, Robards decided to join the Navy.

==Naval service in World War II==
As a [[Naval_rating#United States Navy|radioman 3rd class]] in the Navy, Robards served aboard a [[heavy cruiser]], the [[USS Northampton (CA-26)|USS ''Northampton'']] (CA-26) in 1941. On [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7, 1941]],  he was aboard the ''Northampton'' in the [[Pacific Ocean]] about {{convert|100|mi|km}} off Hawaii. Contrary to some stories, he witnessed the devastation of the Japanese attack on Hawaii only afterwards, when the ''Northampton'' returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Gary L.; Shain, Stacie L., with Davidson, Arlen C., (2004). ''Duty, Honor, Applause — America's Entertainers in World War II''. p. 264. [[Lyon's Press]], [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], [[Connecticut]]. ISBN 1-59228-550-3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Northampton'' was later directed into the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal campaign]] in [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|World War II's Pacific theater]], where she participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]].

During the [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] on Guadalcanal on the night of November 30, 1942, the ''Northampton'' was sunk by hits from two Japanese [[torpedo]]es. Robards found himself treading water until near daybreak, when he was rescued by an American [[destroyer]]. For its service in the war the ''Northampton'' was awarded five battle stars.

Two years later, in November 1944, Robards was radioman on the [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|USS ''Nashville'']] (CL-43), the flagship for the [[Battle of Mindoro|invasion of Mindoro]] in the northern [[Philippines]]. On December 13, she was struck by a [[kamikaze]] aircraft off [[Negros Island]] in the Philippines. The aircraft hit one of the port five-inch gun mounts, while its two bombs set the midsection ablaze. There were 223 casualties, and the ''Nashville'' was forced to return to Pearl Harbor and then to the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]], for repairs.

Robards served honorably during the war, but was not a recipient of the U.S. [[Navy Cross]] for bravery, as has been recorded in numerous uncited resources.  The inaccurate story that he was a Navy Cross recipient derives from a 1979 column by [[Hy Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Hy. ''Panorama'' magazine, Vol. II, No. 1, Sunday ''Daily Herald'', January 7, 1979, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that Robards was awarded the medal.  From this false story, many subsequent references repeated the inaccuracy.  But Robards's name does not appear on any official or semi-official rolls of Navy Cross recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner, C. Douglas. ''Index: Recipients of the Navy Cross, All Wars/All Periods, All Branches of Service''. Pueblo CO, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was on the ''Nashville'' that Robards first found a copy of [[Eugene O’Neill]]’s play ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' in the ship’s library.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', January 20, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaughnessy&quot;&gt;Black, Steven A., ''et al.'' (editors) (2002). ''Jason Robards Remembered — Essays and Recollections''. [[McFarland &amp; Co.]], [[Jefferson, North Carolina|Jefferson]], [[North Carolina]]. ISBN 978-0-7864-1356-0.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in the Navy that he first started thinking seriously about becoming an actor. He had [[Master of Ceremonies|emceed]] for a Navy band in Pearl Harbor, gotten a few laughs and decided he liked it. His father suggested he enroll in the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Robards decided to get into acting after the war and his career started out slowly. He moved to New York City and found small parts — first in [[radio]] and then on the [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. His big break was landing the starring role in [[José Quintero]]'s 1956 [[off Broadway|off-Broadway-theatre]] production and the later 1960 television film of O'Neill's ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'', portraying the philosophical salesman Hickey; he won an [[Obie Award]] for his stage performance.  He later portrayed Hickey again in a 1985 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival also staged by Quintero, who also directed Robards in Broadway productions of O'Neill's plays: ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]'' (1956, as Jamie Tyrone, and 1988, as Tyrone, Sr.), ''[[Hughie]]'' (1964), ''[[A Touch of the Poet]]'' (1977) and ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'' (1973). He repeated his role in ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' in the [[Long Day's Journey into Night (1962 film)|1962 film]] and televised his performances in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' (1975) and ''Hughie'' (1984).

Robards also appeared on stage in a revival of O'Neill's ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1988) directed by [[Arvin Brown]], as well as [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1960), [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' (1964), [[Clifford Odets]]'s ''The Country Girl'' (1972) and [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[No Man's Land (play)|No Man's Land]]'' (1994).

He had made his film debut in the two-reel comedy ''Follow That Music'' (1946), but after his Broadway success he was invited to make his feature debut in ''[[The Journey (1959 film)|The Journey]]'' (1959).  He became a familiar face to movie audiences throughout the 1960s, notably for his performances in ''[[A Thousand Clowns (film)|A Thousand Clowns]]'' (1965) (repeating his stage performance), ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]'' (1968) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968).

He appeared on television [[anthology series]], including two segments in the mid-1950s of  [[CBS]]'s ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]''.

Robards played three different [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] in film. He played the role of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the TV movie ''The Perfect Tribute'' (1991) and supplied the voice for two television documentaries, first for &quot;The Presidency: A Splendid Misery&quot; in 1964, and then again in the title role of the 1992 documentary miniseries ''Lincoln''. He also played the role of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'' (1981) and supplied the Union General's voice in the [[PBS]] miniseries ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990). He also played [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in ''FDR: The Final Years'' (1980). 

Robards appeared in two dramatizations based on the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 1976 he portrayed [[Washington Post]] executive editor [[Ben Bradlee]] in the film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', based on the book by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]]. The next year, he played fictional president Richard Monckton (based on [[Richard Nixon]]) in the 1977 television miniseries ''Washington: Behind Closed Doors'' based on [[John Ehrlichman]]'s [[roman à clef]] ''[[The Company (Ehrlichman novel)|The Company]]''. In 1983, Robards starred in the television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' where he played Dr. Russell Oakes. The movie is one of the most viewed television programs of all time.

Robards voiced a number of documentaries, including [[Ken Burns]]'s ''[[Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio]]'' (1991).

In ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), his final feature film role, the ailing Robards portrayed a dying man who reconnects with his estranged son.

==Awards==
&lt;!--the obie award (for iceman) should probably be included here as well--&gt;
Robards received eight Tony Award nominations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/dyk/ &quot;American Theatre Wing&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; — more than any other male actor {{as of|2009|10|lc=on}}.  He won the Tony for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play|Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for his work in ''[[The Disenchanted]],'' (1959); this was also his only stage appearance with his father.  

He received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in consecutive years for ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976) for portraying ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' [[Editor in chief|editor]] [[Benjamin C. Bradlee|Ben Bradlee]] and ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977) for portraying [[writer]] [[Dashiell Hammett]] (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp &quot;Oscars data base of nominees and winners&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for another Academy Award for his role as [[Howard Hughes]] in ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' (1980).

Robards received the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or a Movie]] for ''[[Inherit the Wind (1988 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emmys.com/awards/awardsearch.php &quot;Emmy Awards Database of nominees and winners&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, Robards received the U.S. [[National Medal of Arts]], the highest honor conferred to an individual artist on behalf of the people.  Recipients are selected by the U.S. [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the medal is awarded by the [[President of the United States]]. 

In 1999, he was among the recipients at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], an annual honor given to those in the [[performing arts]] for their lifetime of contributions to [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/history/home.html &quot;Kennedy Center list of Honorees&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Robards received the 1st Monte Cristo Award, presented by the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], and named after O'Neill's home. Subsequent recipients have included Edward Albee, Kevin Spacey, Wendy Wasserstein, and Christopher Plummer.  

Jason Robards narrated the public radio documentary, ''Schizophrenia: Voices of an Illness'', produced by [[Lichtenstein Creative Media]], which was awarded a 1994 George Foster Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting.  According to ''Time Magazine'', Robards offered to narrate the schizophrenia program, saying that his first wife had been institutionalized for that illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981590-1,00.html#ixzz0qe05Y4EC] Time Magazine &quot;The Souls that Drugs Saved,&quot; October 10, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robards had six children from his four marriages, including actor [[Jason Robards III]] (born 1949) by his first wife, Eleanor Pittman; and actor [[Sam Robards]] by his third wife, actress [[Lauren Bacall]], to whom he was married in 1961: they divorced in 1969, in significant part because of his alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Bacall, Lauren. (2006). ''By Myself and Then Some''. p. 377. [[HarperCollins]], [[New York, New York]]. ISBN 978-0-06-112791-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1972 he was seriously injured in an automobile accident when he drove his car into the side of a mountain on a winding California road, requiring extensive surgery and facial reconstruction. The accident may have been related to his life-long struggle with alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaughnessy&quot;/&gt;

Robards was a [[United States Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] buff and scholar, an interest which informed his portrayal of the voice of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' series by filmmaker [[Ken Burns]].

==Death==
A resident of the [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]] section of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;From the Archives&quot; feature (&quot;The Week of July 8&quot;) of ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' ([[Stamford, Connecticut]]), July 9, 2007, page A7, Stamford edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Robards died of [[lung cancer]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], on December 26, 2000 at the age of 78. He was cremated. 
 
His death was mourned by both fans and actors. &quot;He was the last of a breed of actors who dedicated themselves to a life in the theater.  Without asking for the role, he was our elder statesman,&quot; said actor [[Kevin Spacey]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', February 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Jason Robards Award'' was created by the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] in New York City in his honor and his relationship with the theatre.

Actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] chose her middle name in honor of Robards.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''David Greenspan''' (born 1956) is an award-winning [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[playwright]]. He is the recipient of five [[Obies]], including an award in 2010 for Sustained Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/obie-awards-for-circle-mirror-transformation-and-its-author/  NYTimes Artsbeat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Born 1956 in Los Angeles, California.  He holds a B.A. in Drama from the [[University of California at Irvine]]. He lives in New York City with his long-time partner, the painter William Kennon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donshewey.com/theater_articles/david_greenspan.html    DonShewey Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

&quot;A classicist in experimental clothing, David Greenspan is a playwright who is also passionately involved in the theatre as an actor and director. From his early more autobiographical plays (one of which, Principia, took inspiration from the shifting modalities of Joyce’s Ulysses) to more recent works inspired by (and at times adapted from the work of) Hawthorne, Stein, Molnar, and Thorton Wilder, Greenspan’s theatre is a place where anything can happen. Deliciously complicated, incredibly funny, the work, whether tragic, tender, mysterious or cruel, betrays a profoundly empathic imagination. Both wildly conjured and deeply attentive to diverse literary and theatrical traditions­from vaudeville and Greek mythology to the Bible and boulevard comedy­Greenspan’s plays ask big questions about history, creation, sexual behavior, the complications of family and the very act of performing a play.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://alpertawards.org/archive/winner02/greenspan.html   David Greenspan Alpert Award bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 he collaborated with [[Stephin Merritt]] of [[The Magnetic Fields]] in a musical adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Coraline]]'', under the direction of Leigh Silverman. In an interview with Lizzie Olesker in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'', Greenspan describes the musical: “We suggest things. Not like a large animated musical. There’s no amplification of our voices. We wanted something that was more direct and immediate as opposed to something coming out of a wall of sound.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olesker|first=Lizzie|title=The Power of Suggestion: David Greenspan|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|year=2009|month=May|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2009/05/theater/the-power-of-suggestion-david-greenspan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Jay Potash''' (born 1948), better known by the [[stage name]] '''Ricky Jay''', is an American [[stage magic]]ian, [[actor]], and [[writer]]. He is a [[sleight-of-hand]] expert and is notable for his [[card manipulation|card tricks]], [[card throwing]], memory feats, and stage [[patter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Singer| first = Mark| author-link = Mark Singer| title = Secrets of the Magus| journal = New Yorker| volume = 69 (7)| pages = 54| date = April 5, 1993|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an actor, he is known for his roles in the films ''[[Heist (film)|Heist]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', as well as on the acclaimed HBO series [[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]].

==Early life==
Jay was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York]], to a [[middle class]] [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-648647.html Magician With A Lot Up His Sleeve | Article from The Washington Post | HighBeam Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/175481/the-greatest-living-magician/&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Max Katz, was a well-to-do certified public accountant and amateur magician who introduced Jay to the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rickyjay.com/newyorker.htm The World Wide Website of Ricky Jay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rickyjay.com/hammer_exhibit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0222/6304165a_print.html | work=Forbes | title=Forbes.com - Magazine Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1953, he made television debut on “Time For Pets,” making him at the time the youngest magician to appear on TV performing a full magic act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot; /&gt;

Believed to be the first magician to ever play comedy clubs, he was also probably the first magician to open for a rock and roll band.  At New York's The Electric Circus in the 1960s, he performed on a bill between [[Ike and Tina Turner]], and [[Timothy Leary]] lecturing about acid.  

At least three of his one-man shows, ''Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants'', ''Ricky Jay: On the Stem'', and ''Ricky Jay: A Rogue's Gallery'' were directed by [[David Mamet]], who has also cast Jay in a number of his films. Jay has appeared in productions by other directors, notably [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', as well as Christopher Nolan's ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]''.

A collector and historian of note, he was a student and firm friend of the legendary [[Dai Vernon]], who Jay states was &quot;the greatest living contributor to the magical art.&quot;
An avid collector of rare books (he has spent over five thousand dollars on single books alone) and manuscripts, art, and other artifacts connected to the history of magic, gambling, unusual entertainments, and frauds and confidence games, he is also opposed to any public revelations of the techniques of magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot; /&gt;

Jay joined the cast and [[Crew of Deadwood|crew]] of the [[HBO]] western drama ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' as a guest star and writer for the first season in 2004. The series was created by [[David Milch]] and focused on a growing town in the American West. Jay played card sharp Eddie Sawyer, a dealer in the Bella Union casino of ambitious newcomer Cy Tolliver. Jay wrote the episode &quot;Jewel's Boot Is Made for Walking&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Jewel's Boot Is Made for Walking&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title = Jewel's Boot Is Made for Walking|series = Deadwood|serieslink = Deadwood (TV series)|credits = Steve Shill|writers = Ricky Jay|network = HBO|airdate = 6/6/2004|season = 1|number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the series at the end of the first season.

He also played a henchman to villain Elliot Carver in the James Bond film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''.  

Until recently, Ricky Jay was listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' for throwing a playing card 190 [[Foot (length)|ft]] at {{convert|90|mph}} (the current record is {{convert|216|ft}} by [[Rick Smith, Jr.]]). Ricky Jay can throw a playing card into a [[watermelon]] rind (which he refers to as the &quot;thick, [[pachydermata|pachydermatous]] outer melon layer&quot; of &quot;the most prodigious of household fruits&quot;) from ten paces. In addition, he is able to throw a card into the air like a boomerang and cut it cleanly in half with a pair of &quot;giant scissors&quot; upon its return. In his shows, he often throws playing cards at plastic animals in &quot;self defense&quot;.

===Consultant===
As an expert on magic, gambling, con games and unusual entertainment, Jay has long been a go-to consultant on Hollywood projects, beginning with his work on [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s production of [[Caleb Deschanel]]'s ''[[The Escape Artist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Werner|first=Laurie|title=It's Just Magic. Really.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-06/entertainment/ca-19724_1_ricky-jay/3|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=02-06-1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other early work included teaching [[Robert Redford]] how to manipulate coins for ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'', and working with [[Douglas Trumbull]] on his groundbreaking [[Showscan]] project, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086007/ ''New Magic''] (1983).

In the early 90's, Jay and Michael Weber created a firm, Deceptive Practices, providing &quot;Arcane Knowledge on a Need-to-Know Basis&quot; to film, television and stage productions.  By offering both vast historical expertise and creative invention, they have been able to provide surprisingly practical solutions to real production challenges.  Among many accomplishments, they designed the wheelchair that &quot;magically&quot; hid [[Gary Sinise]]'s legs in ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', as well as the glass that &quot;drinks itself&quot; used by the gorilla in ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]''.  For the Broadway production of &quot;[[Angels in america|''Angels In America'', part 2: Perestroika]]&quot;, they designed an illusion &quot;in which a man climbs to the top of a ladder of light and vanishes in midair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Werner|first=Laurie|title=It's Just Magic. Really.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-06/entertainment/ca-19724_1_ricky-jay|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=02-06-1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other projects they have worked on include: ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conjuring up the magical in movies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/30/entertainment/et-rickyjay30|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=10-30-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'', ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'', ''[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]'', ''[[Wolf (film)|Wolf]]'', ''[[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]'', ''[[I Love Trouble (1994 film)|I Love Trouble]]'', ''[[The Great Buck Howard]]'', ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'', and ''[[Oceans Thirteen]]''.

Additionally, he has worked with libraries and museums on their collections, including the Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts and the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in [[Culver City, CA]].

===Lectures and Exhibitions===
As a writer and speaker on subjects as varied as conjuring literature, con games, sense perception and unusual entertainments, Jay has authored numerous articles and has delivered many lecture/demonstrations. Among his presentations are:

==Early life==
Merkerson, the youngest of five children, was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Michigan]]. Her mother, Ann, was, at the time, the only female in the vehicles operation unit at the Detroit Post Office. Her father worked in a factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/13/S-Epatha-Merkerson.html S. Epatha Merkerson Biography (1952–)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Merkerson's parents separated in 1957.

Merkerson has often been reticent about revealing what her first name really was (Sharon). On the June 11, 2005 episode of [[NPR]]'s ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/jun/050611.waitwait.html Wait Wait – June 11, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; she jokingly claimed that the initial &quot;S,&quot; &quot;stands for 'Sweet' [because] so many people have difficulty with Epatha, which is what I prefer to be called&quot;. She has legally changed her first name to ''S.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/2008/02/22 &quot;S. Epatha Merkerson in 'Come Back, Little Sheba'&quot;]. ''The Leonard Lopate Show'', 2008-02-22. [[WNYC]], New York. Elapsed time approx. 15:50. Retrieved 2008-02-23&lt;/ref&gt; During a segment on the January 31, 2012 episode of ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', when questioned about the origin of her name, Merkerson shared that &quot;Epatha&quot; was the name of &quot;a grade-school teacher who was influential in keeping [her father] in school.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wendy&quot;/&gt; She further went on to clarify that she prefers to be addressed as &quot;Epatha&quot; as opposed to &quot;S. Epatha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wendy&quot;/&gt;

Merkerson graduated from [[Cooley High School]] in 1970. She earned a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] Degree from [[Wayne State University]] and began her [[New York]] theater career in 1978. She was conferred an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Wayne State University in May 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Merkerson made her television debut as Reba the Mail Lady on ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''. &quot;It was one of those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people,&quot; Merkerson said on the NPR program, ''[[Tell Me More]]''. &quot;I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I have to look at the plate. So the entire [time] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, [[Paul Reubens]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91375778 |title=Longtime Actor Discusses Race on the Screen and Stage |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |work= |publisher=NPR|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkerson has also appeared on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', among other series.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; 

She appeared in the first-season ''Law &amp; Order'' episode &quot;Mushrooms,&quot; in which she portrayed the grief-stricken mother of an 11-month-old boy who is shot accidentally. Her performance impressed the producers enough to select Merkerson to replace [[Dann Florek]] as detective squad chief in the series' fourth season.

Merkerson was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] as Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance as Berniece in [[August Wilson]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play, ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' and won an Obie Award in 1992 for her work in ''I'm Not Stupid''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Her screen credits include ''[[Jacob's Ladder (movie)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', ''[[Loose Cannons (1990 film)|Loose Cannons]]'', ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]'' and in [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', in which she played the terrified wife of [[Joe Morton]]. In 2006, she won Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild awards for her performance in the television movie ''[[Lackawanna Blues]]'', her first starring role.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt;  In 2007, she starred on stage in Los Angeles in [[William Inge]]'s ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'' at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in the role made famous by [[Shirley Booth]], and in January 2008 opened on Broadway in the production.  For the revival of ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'', Merkerson earned her second Tony nomination.

In November 2007, Merkerson appeared in a television commercial for [[Coricidin|Coricidin HBP]]. Merkerson also appears in a series of commercials for Uni-Ball pens, directed by Emmy nominee Brent Roske, and in an American Express/NBC Universal ad for the ''Shine the Light'' program, in which she speaks highly of a restaurant not far from her then home in Harlem.  

On April 1, 2010, it was confirmed that after 17 seasons, Merkerson would leave ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' at the end of the show's twentieth season.&lt;ref name=&quot;sem&quot;/&gt;  Her departure from ''Law &amp; Order'', which aired on May 24, 2010, was also the show's final episode. In total, Merkerson had appeared on the series for 16 consecutive seasons (391 episodes)—longer than any other actor associated with the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/news/closing-the-case-with-law-and-orders-s-epatha-merkerson-23018 &quot;Closing the Case With Law &amp; Order's S. Epatha Merkerson&quot;] tv.com, Retrieved January 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Merkerson's character is also the longest-running, African-American character in the history of television.&lt;ref name=&quot;wendy&quot;/&gt;

In 2012, Merkerson became the host of the show ''Find Our Missing'' which highlights the search for missing people of color. It is designed to put names and faces to people of color who have disappeared without a trace. Each episode tells the story of the missing person or persons, beginning with the day they vanished and the frantic searches by loved ones and investigators to find them. ''Find Our Missing'' provides insight into these victims’ lives –their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and how they have touched those around them - from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.

Merkerson also appeared in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2012 film ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]'' as [[Lydia Hamilton Smith]], housekeeper to Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]] ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]).

==Personal life==
Merkerson was formerly married to Toussaint L. Jones. She lives in the Washington Heights section of New York City. Her brother, Barrie Merkerson, currently works as an attorney for the city of Detroit.

Merkerson is an outspoken advocate against smoking and for lung cancer research and awareness. When she guest-hosted on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' on March 2, 2007, she discussed her 23-year addiction to cigarettes, which ended in the early '90s after she woke up one morning unable to breathe. Until May 2007, she sat on the Board of Directors of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

She teaches acting at [[City College of New York]]. 

For her role as Van Buren on ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', she wore a wig. Her real hair is made up in short locks. Merkerson decided to wear a wig for the role to look more &quot;professional&quot;.

In December 2008, Merkerson was sued for $222,908.40 by the [[Gersh Agency]], a talent agency which claimed that they had an oral agreement with Merkerson to represent her at a rate of 10% commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/25/law-and-order-actress-sued-doink-doink/ Law and Order Actress Sued] TMZ.com, December 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">'''Emile Ardolino''' (May 9, 1943 in [[Maspeth, New York]] – November 20, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]], choreographer, and producer, best known for his films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987) and ''[[Sister Act]]'' (1992).

==Biography==
Emile Ardolino, son of [[Italians|Italian]] [[immigrant]]s Emilio and Ester Ardolino, was born in a neighborhood of Queens.  His father – who at the time of Emile's birth was 54 years old – died in 1949, when Emile was 6 years old.

He began his career as an actor in off-Broadway productions, but soon moved to the production side of the business. In 1967, he founded Compton-Ardolino Films with Gardner Compton.&lt;ref&gt;

|page=B12|work=Obituary}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1970s and 1980s Ardolino worked for [[PBS]]; his profiles of dancers and choreographers for their ''[[Dance in America]]'' and ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]]'' series won him a total of 17 [[Emmy Award]] nominations. He actually won the Emmy three times.

Ardolino won an [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Best Documentary]] for the [[1983 in film|1983]] movie ''[[He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin']]''. He found commercial success with the [[1987 in film|1987]] sleeper hit ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', and went on to make several other mainstream films.

Ardolino, who lived openly gay, died in 1993 of complications from [[AIDS]]. He was buried in New York next to his parents, his mother having died in 1975.  His last films, ''The Nutcracker'', (based on [[George Balanchine]]'s [[New York City Ballet]] version), and the television production of ''[[Gypsy (1993 film)|Gypsy]]'' starring [[Bette Midler]] in the role created on Broadway by [[Ethel Merman]], were released and shown posthumously.

== Awards ==
* 1969 [[Obie Award]], for film for the Broadway production of ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''
* 17 Emmy Awards Nomination and 1 winning
* 1983 Academy Award, Best Documentary Feature, ''He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'''

'''William David Daniels''' (born March 31, 1927) is an American actor and former president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (1999 to 2001). He is known for his performance as [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s father in ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), as Howard in ''[[Two for the Road (film)|Two for the Road]]'', as [[John Adams]] in ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]'', as Carter Nash in ''[[Captain Nice]]'', as Mr. George Feeny in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', as the [[voice acting|voice]] of [[KITT]] in ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', and as [[List of St. Elsewhere characters|Dr. Mark Craig]] in ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', for which he won two [[Emmy Awards]].  

==Early life==
William Daniels was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Irene and David Daniels, although he has spoken with a Boston  accent in many of his roles. His father was a builder.&lt;ref name=filmr/&gt; He graduated from [[Northwestern University]] in 1949, where he was a member of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity. He has been married to actress and fellow Emmy Award-winner [[Bonnie Bartlett]] since June 30, 1951; the couple has two children.

==Career==
William Daniels began his career as a member of the singing Daniels family in Brooklyn, New York. He made his television debut as part of a variety act (along with other members of his family) in 1943, on NBC, then a single station in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Toronto Star 1982&quot;&gt;AP WIre Service story, published in The Toronto Star, November 19, 1982, Page D1&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Broadway debut in 1945 in ''[[Life With Father]]'', and remained a busy Broadway actor for decades afterwards. His Broadway credits include roles in ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'', ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]'', ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'' and ''[[A Little Night Music]]''. He earned an [[Obie Award]] for ''[[The Zoo Story]]'' (1960). 

Daniels' motion picture debut was as a school principal in the 1963 anti-war drama ''[[Ladybug Ladybug (film)|Ladybug Ladybug]]''. In 1965, he reprised his Broadway role as a child welfare worker in the screen version of ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. In 1967 he starred in ''[[The Graduate]]'' with [[Dustin Hoffman]], and [[Anne Bancroft]]. In 1969, Daniels starred as John Adams in the Broadway musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]''; he also appeared in the [[1776 (film)|film version]] in 1972. Two years later, he co-starred with [[Larry Hagman]], [[Linda Blair]] and [[Mark Hamill]] in [[Richard Donner]]'s telefilm ''[[Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic]]''.

Daniels' first network television appearance came in 1952 when he portrayed the young [[John Quincy Adams]], eldest son of John and Abigail Adams in the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' drama ''A Woman for the Ages.'' In 1976, he reprised the role as the middle-aged and elder [[John Quincy Adams]] in the acclaimed [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] miniseries ''[[The Adams Chronicles]]'' ([[George Grizzard]] played John Adams). 

He appeared as acid-tongued (but well-meaning) Dr. Mark Craig in ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' from 1982 to 1988, for which he won two Emmy awards. Almost simultaneously, he provided the voice of [[KITT]] in ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' from 1982 to 1986. Daniels said in 1982, &quot;My duties on ''Knight Rider'' are very simple. I do it in about an hour and a half. I've never met the cast. I haven't even met the producer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Toronto Star 1982&quot;/&gt;  Daniels requested that he not receive on screen credit for the role.

He reprised the voice-only role of KITT in 1991 for the television movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'', again in the movie ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', yet again in [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] and [[General Electric|GE]] commercials about talking  machines, and twice in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as well as at the [[Comedy Central]] Roast of his co-star David Hasselhoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Daniels|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0200122/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daniels then portrayed teacher (later principal) [[George Feeny]] at John Adams High School in ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' from 1993 to 2000. Daniels also starred in the 1967 superhero sitcom ''[[Captain Nice]]'', and was a regular on the 1970s TV series ''[[Freebie and the Bean (TV Series)|Freebie and the Bean]]'' and ''[[The Nancy Walker Show]]''. A familiar character actor, he has appeared as a guest star on numerous TV comedies and dramas, including ''Soap'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', and many others. 

In 2012, Daniels appeared in the 9th season of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' as Dr. Craig Thomas, an unlikely mentor to the character of Dr. [[Cristina Yang]] played by actress [[Sandra Oh]]. His character, Dr. Thomas, died in the operating room while performing a procedure to repair a heart defect midway through the season, which forced Yang to move back to Seattle.

It has been announced that he has agreed to reprise his role as [[George Feeny]] in ''Girl Meets World'', the upcoming spin off to ''Boy Meets World''. There is no word on whether this will be a one-time part for the new pilot or a recurring role.

==Awards/honors== 
* Refused the 1969 Tony Award nomination for Featured Actor in a Musical in ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' due to his insistence that the part of John Adams was a leading role rather than supporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview for William Daniels|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/852421%7C155428/William-Daniels/|publisher=TCM|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* In 1986, both Daniels and his wife [[Bonnie Bartlett]], who also played his fictional wife on ''St. Elsewhere'' and ''Boy Meets World'', won Emmy Awards on the same night, becoming the first married couple to accomplish the feat since [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]] in 1965. Lunt and Fontanne were the first to win Emmy Awards for a film, and Bartlett and Daniels were the first couple to win for a [[television program|television series]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''Irene Worth''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (June 23, 1916{{spaced ndash}}March 9, 2002) was an American stage and screen actress who became one of the leading stars of the English and American theatre. (She pronounced her given name with three syllables: &quot;I-REE-nee&quot;.)

==Early life==
'''Harriet Elizabeth Abrams''' was born in [[Fairbury, Nebraska]] to a [[Mennonite]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ratliff |first= Walter |title= [[Pilgrims On The Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva]] |publisher= [[Wipf &amp; Stock]] |year= 2010 |month= January |isbn= 1-60608-133-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Agnes Thiessen and Henry Abrams, were educators. They moved from Nebraska to [[California]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/13/local/me-worth13 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Don | last=Shirley | title=Irene Worth, 85; Actress Was 3-Time Tony Winner | date=March 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[Newport Harbor High School]], Newport Beach, California, [[Santa Ana College|Santa Ana Junior College]], Santa Ana, California and  [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

==Career==

===Shakespeare and the West End===
She joined the [[Old Vic]] company in 1951, worked with [[Tyrone Guthrie]] and there played [[Othello|Desdemona]], Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Portia in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and her first [[Macbeth|Lady Macbeth]]. The company went off to South Africa with Worth as one of the leading ladies. 

In 1953, she joined the fledgling [[Stratford Festival of Canada|Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario]] for its inaugural season. There she was the principal leading lady, performing under an enormous tent with [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/multimedia/video/m_v_4.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Binkie&quot; Beaumont brought her back to London in N. C. Hunter's &quot;Chekhovian&quot; drama, ''A Day by the Sea'', with a cast that included [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]]. She joined the Midland Theatre Company in [[Coventry]] for [[Ugo Betti]]'s ''The Queen and the Rebels''. Her transformation from &quot;a rejected slut cowering at her lover's feet into a redemption of regal poise&quot; ensured a transfer to London, where [[Kenneth Tynan]] wrote of her technique: &quot;It is grandiose, heartfelt, marvellously controlled, clear as crystal and totally unmoving.&quot; 

In the 1950s, Worth demonstrated her exceptional versatility by playing in the farce ''Hotel Paradiso'' in London with Alec Guinness, high tragedy in the title role of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', co-starring [[Eva Le Gallienne]]; and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in ''[[As You Like It]]'' at [[Stratford, Ontario]]. In [[Ivor Brown]]'s play ''William's Other Anne'' she played Shakespeare's first girlfriend [[Anne Whateley]] opposite [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The RSC and the National ===
In 1962, she joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], and it was there that she gave some of her greatest performances. She was Goneril to [[Paul Scofield]]'s Lear in [[Peter Brook]]'s acclaimed ''[[King Lear]]'', the first of many collaborations with Brook.  She recreated her implacable Goneril in the stark, black-and-white film version of this production. She repeated her Lady Macbeth and appeared again for Brook in [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker|The Physicists]]''. Playing an asylum superintendent, she showed the darker side of her acting. She then went to New York in 1965 for the opening of [[Edward Albee]]'s enigmatic ''[[Tiny Alice]]'', in which she co-starred with [[John Gielgud]] and which won her the first of her three [[Tony Award]]s.

She returned to the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] at the Aldwych to repeat her role. She worked with Peter Brook in Paris and also toured [[Iran]] with ''[[Orghast]]'', Brook's attempt to develop an international theatre language. She joined the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] at the Old Vic in 1968 to play Jocasta in Peter Brook's production of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Oedipus]]'', again opposite Gielgud. She was proud to have been in [[Noël Coward]]'s last play ''[[Suite in Three Keys]]'', in which he himself made his last appearance on stage.

===Broadway===
Worth spent most of the 1970s in North America, apart from a season at the [[Greenwich Theatre]] in which she played Gertrude in [[Jonathan Miller]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]''. She played [[Hedda Gabler]] at Stratford, Ontario, which she considered one of her most satisfying achievements and which prompted [[Walter Kerr]] to write, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.&quot; 

Worth played Princess Kosmonopolis in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' opposite [[Christopher Walken]], which brought her a second Tony Award. She was Madame Ranevskaya in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', for which she received another Tony nomination and which featured [[Raúl Juliá]], [[Mary Beth Hurt]] and [[Meryl Streep]], whose career was in its beginning stages. Towards the end of the decade she played Winnie, in [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]''. 

Worth also appeared in the premiere of another Albee play, ''[[The Lady from Dubuque]]'', which closed after twelve performances; a revival of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s'' [[John Gabriel Borkman]]''; ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]]; and ''The Golden Age'' by [[A. R. Gurney]].

===The later years===
She starred as the goddess [[Athena]] in The [[National Radio Theater]]'s 1981 [[Peabody Award]]-winning radio drama of ''The [[Odyssey]] of Homer''. In 1984, [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] invited her to return to the National Theatre to play Volumnia in ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', with [[Ian McKellen]] in the title role. The impresario [[Joseph Papp]] persuaded her to repeat Volumnia on Broadway in a production by [[Steven Berkoff]], when she was once again partnered by Christopher Walken as Coriolanus. She was also seen in [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]'s ''[[The Bay at Nice]]'' (National, 1987) and in ''[[Chère Maître]]'' (New York, 1998 and Almeida, London 1999), compiled by [[Peter Eyre]] from the letters of [[George Sand]] and [[Gustave Flaubert]]. 

In 1991, she won a third Tony for her performance as the tough-as-nails Grandma Kurnitz in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', and later appeared in the film version along with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Mercedes Ruehl]].&lt;ref&gt;www.celebritywonder.com/movie/1993_Lost_in_Yonkers.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1999, she appeared in the film ''[[Eugene Onegin#Film|Onegin]]''. As she was about to begin preview performances in a Broadway revival of [[Jean Anouilh|Anouilh]]'s ''Ring Round the Moon'', Worth had a stroke and never appeared in the production. She continued to act, however, right up until September 2001, when one of her last appearances was with Paul Scofield at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in the two-handed play, ''I Take Your Hand in Mine'', by Carol Rocamora based on the love letters of [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Olga Knipper]].

===Recitals===
During the mid-1960s in New York, Worth and Gielgud had collaborated in a series of dramatic readings, first from T. S. Eliot and [[Edith Sitwell]] and then from Shakespeare. It was a form of theatre at which she became more adept as she grew older, drawing from [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and Noël Coward among others. She referred to them as &quot;her recitals&quot;. In the mid-1990s, she devised and performed a two-hour monologue, ''Portrait of Edith Wharton'', based on [[Edith Wharton|Wharton]]'s life and writings. Using no props, costumes or sets, she created characters entirely through vocal means.

==Personal life==
She died following a second stroke in a New York City hospital, aged 85. At her memorial service, held at The Public Theater in New York City, speakers included [[Edward Albee]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Mercedes Ruehl]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Alan Rickman]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Worth Memorial http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/arts/irene-worth-memorial.html&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also music performed by flutist [[Paula Robison]] and  pianist [[Horacio Gutiérrez]].

'''George Campbell Scott''' (October 18, 1927 – September 22, 1999) was an [[Americans|American]] stage and film [[actor]], [[film director|director]], and [[Film producer|producer]]. He was best known for his stage work, as well as his portrayal of General [[George S. Patton]] in the film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', as General [[Buck Turgidson]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', and as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in [[Clive Donner]]'s [[A Christmas Carol (1984 film)|adaptation]] of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.

==Early life==
George Campbell Scott was born in [[Wise, Virginia]], the son of Helena Agnes ([[married and maiden names|née]] Slemp; 1904–1935) and George Dewey Scott (1902–1988).&lt;ref name=&quot;letter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from George Dewey Scott, father of actor George C Scott|url=http://vagenweb.org/wise/georgesletter.html|publisher=Wise County Virginia Genealogical Research Site|date=January 6, 1981|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died just before his eighth birthday, and he was raised by his father, an executive with [[Buick]]. Scott's original ambition was to be a writer like his favorite author, [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]; while attending [[Redford High School]] in [[Detroit]], he wrote many short stories, none of which were ever published. As an adult, he tried on many occasions to write a novel, but was never able to complete one to his satisfaction. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Scott joined the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], serving from 1945–49. He was assigned to [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|8th and I Barracks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in which capacity he taught [[English literature]] and radio speaking/writing at the [[Marine Corps Institute]]. His primary duty, however, was as an honor guard for military funerals at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. He later claimed his duties at Arlington led to his drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm|title=Obituaries—George C. Scott: The Man Who Refused an Oscar|date=September 23, 1999|publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military service, Scott enrolled in the [[University of Missouri]], where he majored in journalism and then became interested in drama; he graduated from the university in 1953.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Broadway and film career==
Scott first rose to prominence for his work with [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. In 1958, he won an [[Obie Award]] for his performances in ''[[Children of Darkness]]'' (in which he made the first of many appearances opposite his future wife, actress [[Colleen Dewhurst]]), for ''[[As You Like It]]'', and for playing [[Richard III of England|the title character]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (a performance one critic said was the &quot;angriest&quot; Richard III of all time).&lt;ref name=&quot;obie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153529.html|title=1957–1958 Obie Awards|publisher=Infoplease.com|year=2007|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year, winning critical acclaim for his portrayal of the prosecutor in ''[[The Andersonville Trial]]'' by [[Saul Levitt]]. This was based on the military trial of the commandant of the infamous [[American Civil War|Civil War]] prison camp in [[Andersonville, Georgia]]. His performance earned him a mention in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. In 1970, Scott directed a highly acclaimed television version of this same play. It starred [[William Shatner]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Jack Cassidy]], who was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as the defense lawyer in this production.

[[File:George C. Scott - Geraldine Page - 1959.JPG|thumb|left|with [[Geraldine Page]] (1959)]]
Scott continued to appear in and sometimes direct Broadway productions throughout the 1960s. The most commercially successful show in which he worked was [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' (1968). The show is composed of three separate one-act plays all utilizing the same set, with Scott portraying a different lead character in each act, and ran for 1,097 performances.

He made many television appearances, including an episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', in the episode &quot;The Brazen Bell&quot;, in which he recites [[Oscar Wilde]]'s poem &quot;[[The Ballad Of Reading Gaol]]&quot;. That same year, he appeared in NBC's [[medical drama]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', in the episode &quot;I Don't Belong in a White-Painted House&quot;. He appeared opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Julie Harris]] in [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' in a 1961 television production.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivier&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Olivier|author=Terry Coleman|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co|year=2005|page=591|isbn=0-8050-7536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Scott was top billed in the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] hour-long drama series ''[[East Side/West Side|East Side, West Side]]''; he and co-star [[Cicely Tyson]] played urban [[social work]]ers. The show lasted only one season. In 1965 he was cast, under the direction of [[John Huston]], as Abraham with, among others, co-star [[Ava Gardner]] cast as Sarah in the [[Dino de Laurentiis]] film: ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning]]'' which was released by [[20th Century Fox]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001715/bio 4/9/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Scott appeared as Jud Barker in the NBC western ''[[The Road West]]'', starring [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]], [[Kathryn Hays]], [[Andrew Prine]], and [[Glenn Corbett]]. Scott won wide public recognition in the film ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', in which he played a wily prosecutor opposite [[James Stewart]] as the defense attorney. Scott was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

[[File:Dr. Strangelove - General Buck Turgidson.png|thumb|In ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964)]]
Scott's most famous early role was in ''[[Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', in which he played General &quot;Buck&quot; Turgidson. It is revealed on the DVD documentary that after having shot many takes of any given scene, [[Stanley Kubrick]] would frequently ask Scott to redo it in an &quot;over the top&quot; fashion. Kubrick proceeded to use this version in the final cut, which Scott supposedly resented.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=James Earl Jones on Dr. Strangelove|url=http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2004/11/james_earl_jone.html|first=Paul|last=Kedrosky|publisher=Infectious Greed|date=November 17, 2004|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott portrayed [[George S. Patton]] in the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' and researched extensively for the role, studying films of the general and talking to those who knew him. Scott refused the Oscar nomination for ''Patton'', just as he had done for his 1962 nomination for ''The Hustler'', but won the award anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Actor George C. Scott Dead at 71|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19990923/aponline075119_000.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 23, 1999|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Motion Picture Academy]] he stated that he didn't feel himself to be in competition with other actors. However, regarding this second rejection of the Academy Award, Scott famously said elsewhere, &quot;The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html|Show Business: Meat Parade|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 1971 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen years later, in 1986, Scott reprised his role in a made-for-television sequel, ''[[The Last Days of Patton]]''. The movie was based on Patton's final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton's life. At the time the sequel was aired, Scott mentioned in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview that he told the Academy to donate his Oscar to the [[General George Patton Museum of Leadership|Patton Museum]] but since the instructions were never put in writing, it was never delivered. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The Oscar is currently{{when|date=September 2012}} displayed at the [[Virginia Military Institute]] museum in [[Lexington, Virginia]], the same institution that generations of Pattons have attended. Scott did not turn down the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance (of which his then wife [[Colleen Dewhurst]] said, &quot;George thinks this is the only film award worth having&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside Oscar|author=Mason Wiley and [[Damien Bona]]|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=February 12, 1986|isbn=978-0-345-31423-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

He continued to do stage work throughout the rest of his career, receiving [[Tony Award]] nominations for his performance as Astrov in a revival of ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' (1973), his [[Willy Loman]] in a revival of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1975), and his performance as Henry Drummond in a revival of ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1996). In the latter play, he had to miss an unusually large number of performances due to illness, with his role being taken over by [[National Actors Theatre]] artistic director [[Tony Randall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=George C. Scott, Celebrated for 'Patton' Role, Dies at 71|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/24/movies/george-c-scott-celebrated-for-patton-role-dies-at-71.html |author=Mel Gussow|date=September 24, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he received an honorary [[Drama Desk Award]] for a lifetime devotion to theatre.

Scott also starred in well-received productions of [[Larry Gelbart]]'s ''[[Sly Fox]]'' (1976) (based on [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]])'', which ran 495 performances, and a revival of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Present Laughter]]'' (1982). He frequently directed on Broadway as well, including productions of ''[[All God's Chillun Got Wings (play)|All God's Chillun Got Wings]]'' (1975) and ''[[Design for Living]]'' (1985), as well as being an actor/director (''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'', and ''[[On Borrowed Time]]'' (1991)).

In 1971, Scott gave two more critically acclaimed performances, as a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Sherlock Holmes]] in ''[[They Might Be Giants (film)|They Might Be Giants]]'' and as an [[alcoholic]] doctor in the [[black comedy]] ''[[The Hospital]].'' Despite his repeated snubbing of the Academy, Scott was again nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for the latter role. Scott excelled on television that year as well, appearing in an adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Price'', an installment of the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' anthology. He was nominated for, and won, an [[Emmy Award]] for his role, which he accepted.

Scott also starred in the popular 1980 horror film ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'', with [[Melvyn Douglas]].

She does have a certain consistent style, but when you examine her work you find enormous variety of color and intelligence.|source=''Scott on Some Aspects of Acting'', ''Time'', March 22, 1971||width=40%||quoted=1}}

In 1989, Scott starred in the television movie ''[[The Ryan White Story]]'', as Charles Vaughan, the lawyer defending [[Ryan White]] from discrimination. In 1990, he voiced &quot;Smoke&quot;, the villain in the television special ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'', and he also voiced the villainous Percival McLeach in [[Disney]]'s ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' that same year. He was featured in ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' the same year. The following year, he hosted the TV series ''[[Weapons At War]]'' on [[A&amp;E TV]] but was replaced after one season by [[Gerald McRaney]]. ''Weapons At War'' moved to [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] with Scott still credited as host for the first season. Scott was replaced by [[Robert Conrad]] after his death in 1999.

Scott had a reputation for being moody and mercurial while on the set. &quot;There is no question you get pumped up by the recognition,&quot; he once said, &quot;Then a self-loathing sets in when you realize you're enjoying it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=The Beauty Who Tamed the Beast|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067401,00.html|accessdate=2011-12-23|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 7, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous anecdote relates that one of his stage costars, [[Maureen Stapleton]], told the director of Neil Simon's ''Plaza Suite,'' &quot;I don't know what to do—I'm scared of him.&quot; The director, [[Mike Nichols]], replied, &quot;My dear, everyone is scared of George C.

==Politics==
In 1982, Scott appeared in a campaign commercial for [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] U.S. Senator [[Lowell P. Weicker]] of [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ravo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/02/nyregion/a-snoozing-bear-upsets-courtly-connecticut-politics.html?pagewanted=all| title=A Snoozing Bear Upsets Courtly Connecticut Politics| author=Nick Ravo|work=The New York Times| date=November 2, 1988|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Weicker, Scott was at that time a resident of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].

==Personal life and death==
[[File:George C. Scott grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|upright|thumb|George C. Scott's unmarked grave]]
Scott was married five times:
# Carolyn Hughes (1951–1955) (one daughter, Victoria, born December 19, 1952)
# Patricia Reed (1955–1960) (two children: Matthew – born May 27, 1957 – and actress [[Devon Scott]] – born November 29, 1958).
# The [[Canada|Canadian]]-born actress [[Colleen Dewhurst]] (1960–1965), by whom he had two sons, writer Alexander Scott (born August 1960), and actor [[Campbell Scott]] (born July 19, 1961). Dewhurst nicknamed her husband &quot;G.C.&quot;
# He remarried Colleen Dewhurst on July 4, 1967, but they divorced for a second time on February 2, 1972.
# American actress [[Trish Van Devere]] on September 4, 1972, with whom he starred in several films, including the supernatural thriller ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980). Scott adopted Trish's nephew, George D. Scott and resided in Malibu. They remained married until his death in 1999.

He had a daughter, Michelle (born August 21, 1954) with Karen Truesdell.

While he was divorced from Colleen Dewhurst, he developed a stormy relationship with actress [[Ava Gardner]] fueling their bouts with alcohol; continuing an age-old problem dating back to his military service. Scott died on September 22, 1999, aged 71, of a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]. His remains were buried in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, California]], in an unmarked grave.

'''Cliff Gorman''' (October 13, 1936 – September 5, 2002) was an American stage and screen actor.  He won an [[Obie award]] in 1968 for the stage presentation of ''[[The Boys in the Band (play)|The Boys in the Band]]'', and went on to reprise his role in the 1970 [[The Boys in the Band|film version]].

==Life and career==
Gorman was born in New York City, New York, the son of Ethel (née Kaplan) and Samuel Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Cliff-Gorman.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A16FE3D5E127A93C4A9178DD85F458785F9&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorman won a [[Tony Award]] in 1972 for playing [[Lenny Bruce]] in the play ''[[Lenny (play)|Lenny]]''. Although the [[Lenny (film)|film version]], directed by [[Bob Fosse]], featured [[Dustin Hoffman]], Gorman was recruited to portray a Dustin Hoffman-like character portraying Lenny Bruce, in a side-story in Fosse's auto-biographical film ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7292">'''Lee Breuer''' (born 1937) is an [[United States|American]] academic, educator, film maker, poet, lyricist, writer and stage director.

==Work with Mabou Mines==
Lee Breuer is a founding artistic director of [[Mabou Mines|Mabou Mines Theater Company]] in [[New York City]], which he began in 1970 with colleagues [[Philip Glass]], [[Ruth Maleczech]], [[JoAnne Akalaitis]], [[David Warrilow]], and [[Frederick Neuman]]. 

Breuer's most recent work with Mabou Mines was the puppet opera, ''Red Beads'', created in collaboration with puppeteer [[Basil Twist]] and composer [[Ushio Torikai]]. Of the September 2005 New York City premiere, the New York Times said: ''&quot;… theater as sorcery; it is a crossroads where artistic traditions meet to invent a marvelous common language. It is a fairy tale, a puppet play and a chamber opera… amazing work.&quot;''

His previous Mabou Mines production, ''Mabou Mines Dollhouse'', a deconstruction of the [[Ibsen]] classic, won 2004 [[Obie Award]]s for Best Director and Best Performance. The production continues its international touring with upcoming featured engagements including Paris, Hong Kong, and tours in Europe, America, Asia and Australia. Another production is being planned for production in Buenos Aires and touring in South America, and a high definition video production is being planned for international production and release. {{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Most of Breuer's previous work with Mabou Mines premiered at [[The Public Theater]] (NYC) under the patronage of the late [[Joseph Papp]], and at the [[La Mama Experimental Theater Club]] under the patronage of Ellen Stewart. These include his Obie-winning adaptation of three works by [[Samuel Beckett]]:
''Play'', ''Come and Go'' and ''The Lost Ones''. 

He authored/directed [[Mabou Mines]]' trilogy,
''Animations'', including ''The B Beaver'', ''The Red Horse'' and ''The Shaggy Dog Animation'', which was awarded the Obie for Beat Play in 1978. In 1980 Breuer received two Obies for writing and direction of his play, A Prelude to a Death in Venice''. He also wrote and directed ''An Epidog'', the winner of the President's Commission Kennedy Center-American Express Award for Best New Work.

==The Gospel at Colonus==
Breuer's best-known work is ''[[The Gospel at Colonus]]'', a Pentecostal Gospel rendering of Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', created with composer [[Bob Telson]] and starring [[Morgan Freeman]]  and [[Clarence Fountain]]. It premiered at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]'s &quot;Next Wave Festival&quot;. It was later performed on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in 1988 for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. The production received numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize nomination (1988), the Obie for Best Musical (1984), and an [[Emmy]].

The Gospel at Colonus would go on to performances worldwide (Paris, Spoleto, Edinburgh, Moscow, Barcelona, London, Avignon). It was recreated for the 70th Anniversary of New York's legendary Apollo Theater for two weeks in the fall of 2004 starring [[Charles S. Dutton]] and Jevetta Steele. {{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Additional productions==
Previously Lee Breuer mounted ''[[The Tempest]]'' for [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Shakespeare in the Park]], starring [[Raul Julia]]. 

His music-theater collaborations as author and director with Bob Telson include ''Sister Suzie Cinema'', which premiered at The Public Theater and was televised on the PBS series, &quot;Alive from Off Center&quot;.

Lee Breuer has directed eleven Obie Award winning productions over a period of thirty years including [[David Warrilow]] in ''The Lost Ones'' (1974); Bill Raymond in ''A Prelude to Death in Venice'' (1979);  [[Ruth Maleczech]] in ''Hajj'' (1986); [[Yoshida Tamamatsu]] in ''The Warrior Ant'' (1990); Ruth Maleczech, Isabel Monk, Karen Kandel and Greg Mehrten in ''Mabou Mines Lear'' (1991); Karen Kandel in ''Peter and Wendy'' (1997); and Maude Mitchell in ''Mabou Mines Dollhouse'' (2004).

His involvement outside of the U.S., includes &quot;Yi Sang Counts to Thirteen&quot;, which is now open-run in Korea(South)

==Fellowships, awards, et al==
Breuer has been:
* [[MacArthur Fellowship|John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow]]
* Bunting Fellow
* [[Guggenheim Fellow]]
* [[Fulbright Fellow]] (twice)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">'''Norman René''' (1951 - May 24, 1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[theatre director|theatre]] and [[film director]] and [[film producer]] who frequently collaborated with [[playwright]] [[Craig Lucas]].

==Biography==
René was born in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He studied [[psychology]] for a year at [[Johns Hopkins University]] before transferring to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to pursue acting. While there, he realized he was better suited for directing, and during three summer breaks he ran the [[repertory]] Red Barn Theater in [[Pittsburgh]]. 

After graduating in 1974, René moved to [[New York City]]. Three years later he teamed with three Carnegie Mellon alumni to found the [[off-off-Broadway]] Production Company, where he served as [[artistic director]] and directed and/or supervised productions such as ''[[The Guardsman]]'' and ''[[Blues in the Night (musical)|Blues in the Night]]''. The company included [[Julie Hagerty]], [[Judith Ivey]], [[Treat Williams]], [[Mark Linn-Baker]], and [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]].

René met Craig Lucas in 1979. Their first collaboration was ''[[Marry Me A Little (musical)|Marry Me a Little]]'' in 1981. The two wrote a script incorporating songs that had been written for but discarded from [[Stephen Sondheim]] musicals, and René also directed. They followed this with the plays ''Missing Persons'' (1981) and ''Blue Window'' (1984); ''Three Postcards'' (1987), an original music by Lucas and [[Craig Carnelia]]; and another play, ''Reckless'' (1988). In 1990 they joined forces for what would prove to be their biggest commercial and critical success, ''[[Prelude to a Kiss (play)|Prelude to a Kiss]]'', for which René won the [[Obie Award]] for Best Director. ''Prelude'' later transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where he had directed ''Precious Sons'' by [[George Furth]] in 1986.

René was nominated twice for the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Director of a Play, for ''Reckless'' and ''Prelude''. 

René directed an episode of ''[[American Playhouse]]'' in 1987, and made his [[feature film]] directorial debut with ''[[Longtime Companion]]'', scripted by Lucas, in 1990. For his work on that film, he won the Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and was nominated for the Critics Award at the [[Deauville Film Festival]]. He co-produced and directed the [[Prelude to a Kiss (film)|1992 screen adaptation]] of ''Prelude'' with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Meg Ryan]] and directed the [[Reckless (1995 film)|1995 film version]] of  ''Reckless'' with [[Mia Farrow]] and [[Mary-Louise Parker]]. 

René died of complications from [[AIDS]] in New York City. He is survived by his long-term boyfriend, Kevin McKenna.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{citation |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DA1139F935A15756C0A960958260 |title=Obituary |periodical=[[New York Times]] |date=1996-05-26 |first=Stephen |last=Holden |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For that performance he received the ''Backstage West'' Garland Award for Best Actor and was nominated for Best Actor by the L.A. Critics Drama Circle and by the LA Alliance Ovation Awards.  

In 2009 he was in the Broadway revivals of ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Broadway Bound]]''.  The First, BRIGHTON BEACH, opened to wide critical acclaim and then closed one week later.  Much has been written regarding the demise, but all fingers have pointed to mishandling by the producers.  BROADWAY BOUND never opened.

He continued his association with Laurie Metcalf appearing with her in THE OTHER PLACE Off-Broadway.

He can be heard in over 100 [[audiobook]]s and has received five [[Audie Awards]] and two Best Voices of the Year Awards from AudioFile Magazine

'''Nell Carter''' (September 13, 1948 – January 23, 2003) was an American singer and actress. She won a [[Tony Award]] for her performance in the Broadway musical ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (musical)|Ain't Misbehavin']]'', as well as an [[Emmy Award]] for her reprisal of the role on television. 

From 1981 to 1987, Carter starred in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Gimme a Break!]]''. She received two Emmy and two [[Golden Globe]] nominations for her work on the series.

==Early life==
Born '''Nell Ruth Hardy''' in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], she was one of nine children born to Horace and Edna Mae Hardy. When she was two years old, her father, Horace, was electrocuted after he stepped on a live power line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCann|first=Bob |title=Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-43790-1|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?t=the-highs-and-lows-of-nell-carter&amp;id=690|title=The Highs and Lows of Nell Carter|last=Crowther|first=Linnea|date=2012-01-23|publisher=legacy.com|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, she began singing on a local [[gospel]] radio show and was also a member of the church choir. At the age of 16, she was raped at gunpoint and became pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter, Tracey, who was raised by her aunt. At the age of 19, she left Birmingham and moved to [[New York City]]. During this time, she changed her surname to &quot;Carter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot; /&gt; While living in New York City, Carter sang in coffee shops before landing her first role on Broadway in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003-02-10|title=Stage, Television Star Nell Carter Dies at 54|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=103|issue=7|page=49|issn=0021-5996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7r0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=nell+carter+birmingham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dr3IUN2RFMOLrAGHloCwDw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=nell%20carter%20birmingham&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Carter made her Broadway debut in the 1971 rock opera ''[[Soon (musical)|Soon]]'', which closed after three performances.  She was the Music Director for the 1974 [[Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective]]'s production of &quot;What Time of Night It Is&quot;. Carter appeared alongside [[Bette Davis]] in the 1974 stage [[musical theatre|musical]] ''Miss Moffat'', based on Davis' earlier film ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn Is Green]]''. The show closed before making it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She broke into stardom in the musical ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (Broadway show)|Ain't Misbehavin]]'', for which she won a [[Tony Award]] in 1978. She also won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for the same role in a televised performance in 1982. Additional Broadway credits included ''[[Dude (musical)|Dude]]'' and ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''.

In 1979, she had a part in the [[Miloš Forman]]-directed musical [[film adaptation]] of ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]''. Her vocal talents are showcased throughout the motion picture soundtrack. One of the more memorable moments in the film involves her rendition of the song &quot;White Boys&quot; where she can be seen dancing playfully as she performs the song (alongside ''Ain't Misbehavin'' co-star, [[Charlayne Woodard]]).

In 1978, Carter was cast as Effie White in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]],'' but departed the production during development to take a television role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera, ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' in [[New York]]. When ''Dreamgirls'' premiered in late 1981, [[Jennifer Holliday]] had taken over the lead. Carter also took a role on television's ''[[The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo]],'' before landing a steady role as Nell Harper on the sitcom ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'', for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] and [[Emmy Award]] nominations. The popular show lasted from 1981 to 1987. 

Within a couple of a years after ''Gimme a Break!'', Carter pursued new TV series projects. In 1989, she shot a pilot for NBC entitled ''Morton's By the Bay'', which aired as a one-time special in May of that year. In this, Carter played the assistant to the owner of a banquet hall, and the focus was on her and her mad-cap staff. [[Alan Ruck]] and [[Jann Karam]] co-starred. NBC passed on the series development. In October of that same year, she performed &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot; prior to Game 4 of the [[1989 World Series]], played at [[Candlestick Park]] in [[San Francisco]].  The following year, Carter starred in the CBS comedy ''[[You Take the Kids]]''. The series, which was perceived as being the black answer to ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' due to its portrayal of a working-class African-American family, featured Carter as a crass, no-nonsense mother and wife. ''You Take the Kids'' faced poor ratings and reviews, and had a month's run from December 1990 to January 1991.

During the early 1990s, Carter appeared in [[low-budget film]]s, [[TV special]]s, and on [[game show]]s such as ''[[Match Game#Match Game (1990-91, ABC)|Match Game '90]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. She also co-starred in ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]'' from 1993 to 1995. 

In the mid-1990s, Carter appeared on Broadway in a revival of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' as Miss Hannigan. She was very upset when commercials promoting the show used a different actress, [[Marcia Lewis]], a white actress, as Miss Hannigan. The producers claimed that the commercials, which were made during an earlier production, were too costly to reshoot. Carter felt that [[racism]] played a part in the decision. &quot;Maybe they don't want audiences to know Nell Carter is black&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/77475.html/ Nell Carter, Ain't Misbehavin' Star, Dead at 54 - Playbill]&lt;/ref&gt; she told the ''[[New York Post]]''. However, the ads did mention that Carter was in the show. &quot;It hurts a lot&quot;, Carter told the Post, &quot;I've asked them nicely to stop it — it's insulting to me as a black woman.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Carter was later replaced by [[Sally Struthers]].

In 2001, she appeared as a special guest star on the [[pilot episode]] of the new [[The WB Television Network|WB]] show ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'' and continued with the show, making a total of three appearances in season one. The following year, Carter made two appearances on the show ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.  The following year had her rehearsing for a production of ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', a stage musical of ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' in [[Long Beach, California]], and filming a movie, ''[[Swing (2003 film)|Swing]]''. Carter's final onscreen appearances was in the comedy film ''[[Back by Midnight]]''. It was released in 2005, two years after her death.

==Personal life==
After ''Gimme a Break!'' began, Carter's life took a turbulent turn. She attempted [[suicide]] in the early 1980s, and entered a drug [[detoxification]] facility around 1985. Her brother, Bernard, died of complications due to [[AIDS]] in 1989.

She married mathematician and lumber executive George Krynicki, and [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to Judaism in 1982 (she had been born [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and raised [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]).&lt;ref name=jweekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/19245/-pop-soul-belter-nell-carter-54-devoted-convert-to-judaism-dies/|title=‘Pop-soul belter’ Nell Carter, 54, devoted convert to Judaism, dies|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|date=2009-01-31|publisher=jweekly.com|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3984109.html?refid=gg_x_02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,76413,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Actress Nell Carter Dies at 54 | date=January 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carter had three children: daughter Tracy and two sons, Daniel and Joshua. She adopted both her sons as newborns over a four-month period. She attempted to adopt twice more but both adoptions fell through. In one case she brought home a child, Mary, but the birth parents demanded money before they would sign the adoption papers. In her final attempt, she allowed a young pregnant woman to move into her home with the plan that she would adopt the child, but the mother decided to keep her baby. 

In 1992, Carter had surgery to repair two [[aneurysm]]s. She divorced Krynicki and married Roger Larocque the same year, divorcing Larocque the next year. She declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1995 and again in 2002. She also endured three [[miscarriage]]s.

Appearing emotional and tearful on an episode of the ''[[Sally Jessy Raphael Show]]'', Carter explained how she went to a [[Liza Minnelli]] concert during a turbulent time of her life. Carter told Raphael how Minnelli, seeing Carter in an agonized state, ran offstage to tell her sister, [[Lorna Luft]], to go out and take Carter backstage so that she could get some help. Minnelli and Luft helped get Carter into rehab for her [[cocaine]] problem, which she conquered.

==Death==
Having previously survived two brain aneurysms, Carter died at the age of 54 on January 23, 2003, from [[heart disease]] complicated by [[diabetes]] in her Beverly Hills home. She is survived by her domestic partner, Ann Kaser, her two sons, Joshua and Daniel and daughter Tracy Ruth.&lt;ref name=jweekly /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tiwqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hUUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3743,5636548&amp;dq=nell+carter+death&amp;hl=en|title=Carter's death natural|date=2003-05-07|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|page=12B|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter is interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

'''Priscilla Lopez''' (born February 26, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[singing|singer]], [[dancer]], and [[actress]].

==Early life==
Lopez was born in the [[Bronx, New York]] to Francisco Lopez, a hotel banquet foreman and Laura (née Candelaria), who were moved to New York from their native Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2008/02/from_priscilla_lopez_the_lowdo.html ''From Priscilla Lopez, the lowdown on 'In the Heights'''] from ''www.nj.com'' 28 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Priscilla-Lopez.html Biodata]&lt;/ref&gt; She has had the distinction of appearing in two [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] landmarks: one of its greatest hits, the highly-acclaimed, long-running ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', and, as a teenager, in one of its biggest flops, the infamous musical version of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', which closed before opening night.

==Career==

===Broadway===
Lopez graduated from Manhattan's [[High School of Performing Arts]], where she majored in drama; her experience as a drama student are played out in the musical ''A Chorus Line''. Had ''Tiffany's'' survived, it would have marked her debut on the [[Great White Way]], but the production was plagued with so many problems that its creative team deemed it impossible to fix. From there she moved on to ''[[Henry, Sweet Henry]]'', which lasted only two months at the end of 1967, when she was 19 years old. Her luck was no better the following year, when ''[[Her First Roman]]'' lasted a mere two weeks. 

Lopez finally achieved critical and popular success as a replacement in two shows, [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), followed by the 1972 hit ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' in 1974 (taking over the role of Fastrada from original performer [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]]). Two years later, she was invited by director and choreographer [[Michael Bennett]] to participate in a series of tape-recorded group therapy-style sessions in which chorus boys and girls - AKA &quot;Gypsies&quot; - bared their souls and discussed their lives, dreams, and frustrations. From this emerged ''A Chorus Line'' (1975), and Lopez was invited to join the cast portraying Diana Morales, a character patterned very much after herself. She introduced the hit song &quot;What I Did for Love&quot;, and sang &quot;Nothing&quot;, a song about her disastrously unsupportive drama class.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Michael.[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2008/02/from_priscilla_lopez_the_lowdo.html &quot;From Priscilla Lopez, the lowdown on 'In the Heights'&quot;] &quot;New Jersey Star-Ledger&quot;, February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

In her next production, ''[[A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine]]'' (1980), Lopez stepped out of the ensemble and into the spotlight, utilizing both her comedic and vocal skills. The show had two acts, the first a mini-musical by Dick Vosburgh and Frank Lazarus with additional material by [[Jerry Herman]] about the early days of movie making, the second a send-up of the slapstick [[Marx Brothers]] movies, with Lopez in the role of Harpo. Both she and the show received rave reviews, and it ran nearly a year-and-a-half. And for this, she earned a [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actress. In 1982, [[Tommy Tune]], with whom she had worked in ''Hollywood/Ukraine'', hired her as his assistant on ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'', the musical version of the [[Federico Fellini]] film ''[[8½]]''. Midway through the run, she joined the cast taking over for Tony-winner [[Liliane Montevecchi]] in the role of Liliane La Fleur.  Lopez also appeared on Broadway in the critically acclaimed play ''[[Anna in the Tropics]]'' in 2003. From 2008-2011, Lopez appeared as Camilla in the Broadway production of &quot;In the Heights&quot;
.

===Off-Broadway===
Her [[off-Broadway]] credits include  ''[[Other People's Money]]'', ''[[Key Exchange]]'', 
''[[Extremities]]'', ''[[The Oldest Profession]]'', ''[[Beauty of the Father]]'' and ''[[Class Mothers '68]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] as Best Actress. She also was featured in the [[City Center]] [[Encores!]] production of ''[[Babes in Arms]]''.

===Television===
In 1983 she was the voice of Herself the Elf in the animated TV special ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]''. Lopez had a starring role in the television movie, ''For the Love of My Child: The Anissa Ayala Story'' (1993), in which she played a mother, who, along with her husband, conceives a child to provide a suitable bone-marrow donor for their older daughter in 1990. Other television work includes ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]'' and, most recently, ''[[Cosby]]''.  She also had a key role in the short-lived 1986 medical drama ''[[Kay O'Brien]]'', a kind of '' [[Grey's Anatomy]]'' for the '80s, which wound up being ahead of its time.
She was also in episodes of the ABC drama, &quot;Family&quot;, starring Kristy McNichol and Sada Thompson. She played Buddy's (McNichol) dance friend on the Disco episodes.

===Films===
She had a brief role in ''[[Center Stage (2000 film)|Center Stage]]'' as the Broadway Dance Studio teacher who teaches jazz. She appeared in ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' playing the mother of [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s character, and recently completed the film version of the long-running off-Broadway hit, ''[[Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding]]''. She currently appears in the film ''[[Musical Chairs (film)|Musical Chairs]]'', as the disapproving mother of [[E.J. Bonilla]]'s character. The story deals with a couple (Bonilla and [[Leah Pipes]]), who fall in love and join a wheelchair ballroom dancing competition after the girl becomes a paraplegic when struck by a car.

==Personal life==
Lopez is married to Vincent Fanuele; they have two children, Alex and Gabriella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2008/03/06/2008-03-06_priscilla_lopez_returns_to_broadway_in_i.html?page=0 &quot;Priscilla Lopez returns to Broadway in 'In the Heights'&quot;], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', March 6, 2008

'''Ron O'Neal''' (September 1, 1937 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2004) was an American actor, [[film director|director]] and [[screenwriter]] most remembered for his starring role as Youngblood Priest in the [[blaxploitation film]] ''[[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]]''.

== Life and career ==

Ron O'Neal grew up in a working-class black neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], the son of a former jazz musician who now earned his living as a factory worker; his father died when he was 16 years old. Only six months later his brother, who worked as a truck driver, was killed in an accident. Following these tragedies his mother found a job in a hospital in order to sustain the family. He graduated from [[Glenville High School]], then attended [[Ohio State University]], and there became interested in acting after seeing the play ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''. He joined the [[Karamu House]] company in Cleveland, Ohio, working with the oldest African-American theatre company in the US from 1957 until 1964, during which period he appeared in plays such as ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', working all the time as a housepinter for a living. In 1964, he went to New York, teaching acting classes at the [[Harlem Youth Arts Program]] and appearing in [[Off-Broadway]] plays.

In 1969, his theatrical breakthrough came in the Broadway play ''[[Ceremonies in Dark Old Men]]''. In 1970, appearing in [[Charles Gordone]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play, ''[[No Place to Be Somebody]]'' he garnered even more attention, winning an [[Obie Award]] and several other prizes. From there he moved on to cinema with two minor roles in ''[[Move (film)|Move]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' (1971), after which he was contacted by a friend from Cleveland, screenwriter [[Phillip Fenty]], who suggested he star in an all-black film about a drug dealer. Although shot on a meagre budget this film, [[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]], went on to become a major hit at the box office.

This success was followed by the sequel, [[Super Fly T.N.T.]] (1972), in which he starred and directed, yet it turned out to be a failure. After that, parts offered to him frequently were unfortunately limited to that of stereotypical characters such as pimp or drug dealer. In 1975 he returned to Broadway, starring in ''[[All Over Town (play)|All Over Town]]'' under the direction of [[Dustin Hoffman]] and he also appeared in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays during the 1970s, including ''[[Othello]]'',  ''[[Macbeth]]'', and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.

During those years flim roles that went beyond stock characters were few and far between, notable exceptions being his role in ''[[Brothers (1977 film)|Brothers]]'' (1977) and in the TV miniseries ''[[The Sophisticated Gents]]'' (1981). He had a number of TV guest appearances, frequently playing a detective. In 1996 he appeared in the [[Blaxpoitation]] reunion film ''[[Original Gangstas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ron-o-neal biography at answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641938/bio biuography at IMBD.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==

Ron O'Neal was first married to Carol Tillery Banks, November 1973 until 1980 (divorced), and then to
Audrey Pool, until his death in 2004.

== Death ==

He died in 2004 of [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 66 on the same day ''Super Fly'' was released on DVD in the US in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ron O'Neal, 66; Star of Blaxploitation Hit 'Superfly' |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 16, 2004|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/16/local/me-oneal16|accessdate=2011-01-29|first=Dennis|last=McLellan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Marks identified a central theme in Ribman's work as having &quot;a preoccupation with the persistence of the past in the present—a recognition that we all carry with us a heavy baggage of seeds, each of which began sprouting at a different time in the past, and never stopped shooting out tendrils: a bag of memories which can never be simply dumped.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;marks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Buried Child''''' is a play by [[Sam Shepard]] first presented in 1978. It won the 1979 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] and launched Shepard to national fame as a [[playwright]]. ''Buried Child'' is a piece of theater which depicts the fragmentation of the American [[nuclear family]] in a context of disappointment and disillusionment with American mythology and the American dream, the 1970s rural economic slowdown and the breakdown of traditional family structures and values.

==Characters==
*Dodge - in his seventies
*Halie - Dodge's wife; mid-sixties
*Tilden - Their oldest son; late forties
*Bradley - Their next-oldest son, an [[amputee]]; early forties
*Vince - Tilden's son; approx. 22
*Shelly - Vince's girlfriend; 19
*Father Dewis - a Protestant minister; sixties

==Context and Thematic Concerns==

=== Disappointment and disillusionment with American Mythology and the American Dream ===
*The character of Ansel- He is the son which Halie idolizes as an [[All-American]] hero despite his death due to suspicious circumstances in a motel room. Halie fantasizes about his potential to be a Hero, to be an All-American star basketball player, reflecting the American hope in the youth. Yet his death and subsequent denouncement reflects the disappointment and disillusionment which many people experienced when they realised the actuality of the American circumstance.
*The two sons (Tilden and Bradley) both failed their parents' expectation- Both are expected to take over the farm or at least care for the parents in their old age, thus fulfilling the American mythology of the next generation taking over from the last. However both sons are handicapped – Tilden emotionally and Bradley physically. They are unable to care for their parents and thus unable to carry out the [[American Dream]].
*Dodge felt the  failure of the farm and the family as whole. He had failed to make the farm successful, he had not even planted any type of crop for  twelve years! He felt he had not lived up to what a typical American family's dream should have been. The play often shows the father as generally just sitting around doing very little steeped in a major depression.
*The character Shelly is used to show the audience what the ideal family should be. Her disgust with what she expects and what is actually reality helps to show the audience what the American dream should be.

===1970s economic slowdown===
*The house itself is run down, reflecting the poverty of American farms.
*Nothing has been planted in the fields.

===Breakdown of traditional family structures and values===
*Dodge, the ineffectual patriarch, is meant to be the breadwinner and ethical guardian of the family. Instead, he takes on the role of a sardonic alcoholic who is bullied by his wife and children, and thus furthermore disempowered through their actions. His character reflects failed patriarchs in America who have failed to create the family environments idealised in the [[American Dream]].
*The act of incest and the resultant murder are indicative of a breakdown in the ethical rigidity which characterises the typical American family.
*The character of Father Dewis, adulterous and unauthoritative, fails to fulfill the role of moral guardian assigned to him by society, thus reflecting the breakdown of morality and ethics within America.

==Shepard's intention==
Shepard's intention was to create a narrative which communicated and reflected the frustrations of American people but at the same time was engaging and entertaining. Set in a context which is easily recognisable, the American farming family, and centered around issues which are universal, the disillusionment with the American dream and the traditional patriarch, ''Buried Child'' reflects the universal frustrations of American people. The [[Postmodernistic|postmodern]] style which Shepard uses incorporates [[surrealism]] and [[symbol]]ism in the realistic framework of a family drama. This platform allows for engaging visceral theatre. Shepard is able to create images in the imaginations of people through the use of surrealism and symbolism, evoke and harness the experiences of his audience through its postmodern nature and keep the audience comfortable in the trappings of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]].

Some critics consider it part of a [[Family Trilogy]] which includes ''[[Curse of the Starving Class]]'' (1976) and ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=&quot;Simard&quot;&gt;Simard, Rodney. “American Gothic: Sam Shepard's Family Trilogy.” ''Theatre Annual'' 41 (1986): 21-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider it part of a quintet  which includes ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Lie of the Mind]]'' (1985).&lt;ref name=&quot;Roudané&quot;&gt;Roudané, Matthew (2002). ''The Cambridge Companion to Sam Shepard.'' Cambridge University Press, ISBN 9780521777667&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
''Buried Child''  incorporates many postmodern elements such as the mixing of genres, the [[deconstruction]] of a [[Metanarrative|grand narrative]], and the use of [[pastiche]] and layering.

==Mixing of genres==
''Buried Child'' is laid in the framework of realism; the play is essentially a family drama. However, added into the realistic framework are distinct elements of surrealism and symbolism. The three-act structure, the immediate time frame and the setting of the play in reality give it an overall realistic appearance. Yet the use of symbols such as the corn and the rain give the play a symbolist element while the fragmented characterisation and actions like the multiple burials of Dodge are somewhat surreal or dreamlike. The humour is also an essential element of the style, giving the play sardonic, black and even at times slapstick elements. All these stylistic elements combine to give the play an overall postmodern feel.

==Performance history==
''Buried Child'' premiered at The [[Magic Theater]] in San Francisco on 27 June 1978, directed by [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]]. Its New York premiere was at [[Theater for the New City]] in [[New York City]] on October 19, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Richard Eder | title=Reviewed: Buried Child | url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=FC77E7DF1738E632F25754C0A9679D946990D6CF | work=The New York Times | date=1978-11-07 | accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatre critic [[Harold Clurman]] wrote, in ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', &quot;What strikes the ear and eye is comic, occasionally hilarious behavior and speech at which one laughs while remaining slightly puzzled and dismayed (if not resentful), and perhaps indefinably saddened. Yet there is a swing to it all, a vagrant freedom, a tattered song.&quot; It transferred to [[Theatre de Lys]], now the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre]].

The show was revived for a two-month run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1996 following a production at the [[Steppenwolf Theatre]] in [[Chicago]] in 1995. The production, directed by [[Gary Sinise]] at the [[Brooks Atkinson Theater]], was nominated for five [[Tony Awards]] but did not win any.  The script for the production had been reworked by Shepard, allegedly fixing edits that a previous director had made to the text without Shepard's authorization.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Shepard writes that he had felt certain &quot;aspects of the writing still seemed awkward and unfinished&quot; in 1978 and that he was glad for the opportunity to revisit the script for the Steppenwolf production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sam Shepard | title=Buried Child | publisher=Random House, New York | year=2006 | page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gloria Foster was born on November 15, 1933 in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  But as a young child she was put into custody of her mother's grandparents.  Gloria Foster never knew who her father was and she moved to [[Janesville, Wisconsin]] after her mother was hospitalized for a mental illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/62727-Actress-Gloria-Foster-Is-Remembered-at-Manhattan-Memorial Actress Gloria Foster article after her death] ''[[Playbill]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her grandmother, Eleanor Sudds, and her grandfather, Clyde Sudds, raised Gloria Foster on a farm.  As Gloria continued her education she returned to her hometown of Chicago and attended the [[University of Illinois]], where she participated in plays, but did not focus on it.

Print] &quot;[[Performing O'Neil]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gloria Foster was not sure what occupation to pursue, until her godmother introduced her to the [[Goodman Theatre]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shafer, Yvonne 2000&quot;/&gt;  After she auditioned and was accepted, she knew that this was going to be her passion in life, the theater.   She was one of the few African Americans at the Goodman School of Drama, but focused on her study of acting.  During her studying at the Goodman School she also, &quot;learned professional acting skills in the Court Theater at the University of Chicago&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;on actress Gloria Foster&quot;&gt;[http://www.kosmix.com/topic/gloria_foster-Gloria-Foster-biography on actress Gloria Foster] ''[[Kosmix]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of her most influential instructors was Bella Itkin, who cast Gloria in many classical roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;   Her next step in life was to move to New York to pursue a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Acting career==
Gloria Foster began her career on Broadway as she moved to New York in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;on actress Gloria Foster&quot;/&gt;   Her first role was Ruth in the show of ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]''.  She started an acting career as her agent, Ernestine McClendon, sent her on an audition for ''[[In White America]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;  The play was about the history of blacks in the United States and the oppression they had to face.  Gloria Foster, &quot;play[s] a 13-year-old Arkansas girl who tries to enter her Little Rock school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/theater/gloria-foster-stage-actress-is-dead-at-67.html] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was her first distinction and had to play 27 different characters.  This led to her winning an [[Obie Award]] or Off-Broadway Theater Award, which is an, &quot;annual award bested by The Village Voice newspaper to theater artists and groups in New York City&quot;. She also received a two-page article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'', explaining about the wonderful performance and critics said she was up and coming and people should look out for the next pieces she performs in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tributemovies.com/people/Gloria+Foster/10800/] [[Tribute (magazine)|Tribute Movies]].&lt;/ref&gt;   She performed many other plays in New York and on Broadway and the public started to notice her, as she became a bigger star.  Not only did the public start to notice her, but also critics began analyzing her performances.  They wrote that she performed her roles as a, &quot;majestic, full-voiced, statuesque and stunning actress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;  The passion she had for acting was reflected in her performances and an unusual thing happened for her, &quot;an African-American actress around whom producers and directors built production&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;  Instead of Gloria Foster having to audition for roles, people started to make parts for her to be in.  It was her spirit, excitement, and stamina for acting that gave her success in such a hard business.  She was a breakthrough artist who, &quot;played roles previously inaccessible to Blacks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_19_100/ai_79477125/Actress-Gloria-Foster-Succumbs-At-Age-64] ''[[BNET]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gloria Foster, instead of searching for fame by trying to be in many different productions, searched for roles in which she would be able to perform at the best of her ability.  She once said, &quot;Young people today, I think, are thinking in terms of stepping stones…I don't know that I ever thought that way.  It sounds ridiculous, but I was always thinking in terms of a more difficult role&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;  She won fame by performing her roles magnificently, not by performing the maximum number of roles that she could.  She read many scripts, but only chose the ones that spoke truly to her.  By the end of her acting career, she was rewarded with three Obie awards, for ''In White America'' (1963) and ''A Raisin In the Sun'', and was in the Broadway production of ''[[Having Our Say]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[McCann, Bob. &quot;Foster, Gloria.&quot; Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television. North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, 2010. 121-22. Print.] ''[[Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Foster was admitted to a special graduate program in education at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://umassmag.com/Archives/1996/fall_96/biteapple.html#anchor732084 Gloria Foster Biography] [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gloria Foster was married to the actor, [[Clarence Williams III]] in 1967.  They met on the television show ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' that ran from the late 1960s to the early 1970s.  The show was a police drama that featured three young hip crime fighters. In the show Clarence Williams played the black cop, Linc Hayes. Foster made two guest appearances on the show.  The two also were in a movie, ''[[The Cool World (film)|The Cool World]]'', in 1964 together.  In 1984 they filed for a divorce, but remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929934/bio-Clarence-Williams-III] ''[[IMDb]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams was the one to announce her death in 2001.  While Foster did not have many close relatives, it is known that she stayed in contact with her sister-in-law, [[Cicely Tyson]]. Tyson stated that although they did not see each other often, their telephone conversations would often last for hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill.com&quot;/&gt;  She was a member of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority.

==Highlights==
Moving from the New York stage, Gloria Foster started to do roles on the big screen.  She was in many theatrical performances and also performed some roles on television.

''[[The Cool World (film)|The Cool World]]'' (1964)- This was Gloria Foster's first appearance on a full-length feature film.  She played Mrs. Custis.  It was on the set of this film that she starred next to her future husband, Clarence Williams III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056952/-The-Cool-World] [[IMDb]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nothing But a Man]]'' (1964)- Gloria Foster plays a woman named Lee, who lives with the main character's (Duff Anderson) father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=85269-Nothing-But-A-Man] ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also active in [[television]], appearing in such programs as ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', two episodes of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' and ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' (1987).

Her character in both ''Law and Order'' episodes was based on the widow of [[Malcolm X]], [[Betty Shabazz]]. The first episode was based on Malcolm X's assassination, Malcolm X played
by [[Hal Miller (actor)|Hal Miller]],  while the second focused on her character's children's acts of revenge against those who they thought were really responsible.

She returned to theater again in 1995, acting alongside [[Mary Alice]] (who was later to replace her in ''[[The Matrix]]'' films following her death), appearing as 103-year-old [[Sarah Louise Delany|Sadie Delany]], in ''Having Our Say'', on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Booth Theatre]], for which she received rave reviews.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[http://www.tribute.ca/people/Gloria+Foster/10800/587 Gloria Foster bio: The Matrix Actor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-10-09/theater/gloria-foster-1936-2001/ Gloria Foster (1936–2001)] ''Villagevoice.com'', Robert Simonson, October 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)- Gloria Foster played the Oracle.  The Oracle helps Neo find out if he is &quot;the one&quot;.  Because the movie did so well, this role was very important to Gloria Foster's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/-The-Matirx] [[IMDb]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' (2003)- Gloria Foster continued to act the role of the Oracle, but unfortunately died during the filming and [[Mary Alice]] continued the role in ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and ''[[Enter the Matrix]]''.

==Death==

Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001 at age 67. The cause of her death was [[diabetes]]. Though she was no longer married, her ex-husband, [[Clarence Williams III]], was the one to announce her death.  A memorial was held at [[Cypress Hills Cemetery]] in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/theater/gloria-foster-stage-actress-is-dead-at-64.html] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of her close friends and also actors and actresses that had performed with her came to attend the funeral.  Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and also good friend who worked with Gloria Foster on ''In White America'' and ''Having Our Say'' was a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Many of the speeches given at the service, showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and also physically.  Duberman, the author of ''In White America'', told the audience that, &quot;she embodied it.  At the end of the scene each night, there were tears streaming down her face, her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact&quot;… &quot;Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  
She is interred in [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]].

When asked why he had been treated in this way, he burst into tears and said he had no idea. Then he went into the [[United States Marines]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Witchel, &quot;The Confessions of John Patrick Shanley,&quot; ''The New York Times Magazine'', November 7,  2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Ferdinand Durang''' (born January 2, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] known for works of outrageous and often [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd]] comedy. His work was especially popular in the 1980s.

== Life ==
Durang was born in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], the son of Patricia Elizabeth, a secretary, and architect [[Francis Ferdinand Durang, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Christopher-Durang.html Biography] at FilmReference.com&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. He attended [[Catholic school]]s as a child, including the Our Lady of Peace School in [[New Providence, New Jersey]] and the [[Delbarton School]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, LucyAnn. [http://www.princetoninfo.com/200508/50817p08.html &quot;A Play That Asks, 'What Happens After?'&quot;], ''U.S. 1 Newspaper'', August 17, 2005. Accessed May 12, 2007. &quot;He wrote his first play at age eight. His Catholic grammar school cancelled class one afternoon and put on his play. Later while he was attending Delbarton School in Morristown, he and a friend wrote two musicals, &quot;Banned in Boston&quot; and &quot;Businessman's Holiday.&quot; You won't find these in his collected works but they certainly suggest a young man with an active imagination and a penchant for writing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English studies|English]] from [[Harvard]] and an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] in playwriting from [[Yale School of Drama]]. He lives in [[Bucks County]] with his partner, John Augustine; they have been together for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/26/theater/newsandfeatures/26dura.html |title=Christopher Durang Explores the Afterlife, Including His Own |first=Dinithia |last=Smith |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durang is openly gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laugh Out Loud With Sigourney Weaver and Snow White|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/theater/seat-filler/2013/04/28/laugh-out-loud-sigourney-weaver-and-snow-white|date=April 28, 2013|work=[[The Advocate]]|first=Daniel|last=Villarreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
His work often deals critically with issues of [[child abuse]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]] and culture, and [[homosexuality]]. While Durang's use of parody and his criticism of many social institutions might appear overly cynical at times, he states: &lt;blockquote&gt;...when I say everyone is crazy that means it’s a very bad day where the amount of crazy people in the world has spread out to the entire universe and it doesn’t seem possible to cope with anything... I think we’re all neurotic. And I do think relationships are certainly difficult. Nonetheless, those lines in the play do get a laugh, so there’s something. It’s not as despairing as it sounds, but I don’t not believe it.&lt;ref&gt;Gholson, Craig. [http://bombsite.com/issues/20/articles/950 &quot;Chris Durang Interview&quot;] ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Summer, 1987. Retrieved May 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His plays have been performed nationwide, including on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Off-Broadway]].&lt;ref name=ibdb&gt;http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=4832 &quot;Internet Broadway Database: Christopher Durang Credits on Broadway&quot; on IBDB&lt;/ref&gt; His works include ''[[Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You]]'', ''[[Beyond Therapy]]'', ''[[Baby With the Bathwater]]'', ''[[The Nature and Purpose of the Universe]]'', ''[[Titanic (play)|Titanic]]'', ''[[A History of the American Film]]'', ''[[The Idiots Karamazov]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Bette and Boo]]'', ''[[Laughing Wild]]'', ''[['Dentity Crisis]]'', ''[[The Actor's Nightmare]]'', ''[[The Vietnamization of New Jersey]]'', ''[[Betty's Summer Vacation]]'', ''[[Naomi in the Living Room]]'', ''[[Adrift in Macao]]'', ''[[Mrs. Bob Cratchit's Wild Christmas Binge]]'', ''[[Miss Witherspoon]]'', ''[[Why Torture is Wrong, and the People Who Love Them]]'', &quot;Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike&quot;, and a collection of one-act parodies meant to be performed in one evening entitled ''[[Durang/Durang]]'' that includes &quot;Mrs. Sorken&quot;, &quot;For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls&quot; (a parody of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]), &quot;A Stye Of the Eye&quot;, &quot;Nina in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Wanda's Visit&quot;, and &quot;Business Lunch at the Russian Tea Room&quot;.

Durang has performed as an actor for both stage and screen. He first came to prominence in his [[Off-Broadway]] satirical review ''Das Lusitania Songspiel'', which he performed with friend and fellow Yale alum [[Sigourney Weaver]]. Later he co-starred in one of his own plays as Matt in ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo'', as well as Man in the original production of ''Laughing Wild''.

=== In film ===
Durang has denounced the [[Robert Altman]] 1987 [[Beyond Therapy (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Beyond Therapy]]'', calling it &quot;horrific&quot; and accusing Altman of totally rewriting the script &quot;so that all psychology is thrown out the window, and the characters dash around acting crazy but with literally no behavioral logic underneath.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Durang has appeared as an actor in the 1987 comedy ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'', 1988's ''[[Mr. North]]'', 1989's ''[[Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed]]'', 1992's ''[[HouseSitter]]'' and 1994's ''[[The Cowboy Way (film)|The Cowboy Way]]''.

He has also written a number of unproduced [[screenplay]]s, including ''The Nun Who Shot Liberty Valance'', ''The House of Husbands'' (which he co-authored with [[Wendy Wasserstein]]), and ''The Adventures of Lola''.

=== On television ===
''Wanda's Visit'', one of the six one-acts in ''Durang/Durang'' was originally written for the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''Trying Times'', and Durang played the part of The Waiter in that production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734032/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopherdurang.com/OneActsLong-Belle-Stye-Wanda.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
He received [[Obie Awards]] for ''Sister Mary Ignatius'', ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo'' and ''Betty's Summer Vacation''. He received a nomination for a [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical]] for ''A History of the American Film''.

Durang has been awarded numerous fellowships and high profile grants including a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], a Rockefeller, the CBS Playwriting Fellowship, the ''Lecomte du Nouy Foundation'' grant, and the ''Kenyon Festival Theatre Playwriting Prize''.

He is a member of the [[Dramatists Guild]] Council, and is co-chair of the playwriting program at [[Juilliard]]. He was also a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Drama in 2006 for ''Miss Witherspoon''.

On May 17, 2010 he was presented with the very first Luminary Award from the [[New York Innovative Theatre Awards]] for his work Off-Off-Broadway.

He was awarded the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] in 2012.

'''''Yellow Face''''' (2007) is a play by [[David Henry Hwang]], featuring the author himself as the protagonist.  It premiered in Los Angeles at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in association with [[East West Players]] and had its [[Off-Broadway]] premiere at the [[Joseph Papp Public Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/yell6060.htm Review by nytheate, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933715.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 Review by Variety, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixing fact and fiction, ''Yellow Face'' is partly autobiographical, with the character Hwang putting on Hwang's play, ''[[Face Value (play)|Face Value]]''. ''Yellow Face'' is a satire that raises deep questions of what race really means, how politics and media function in society, what America really stands for, the importance of both fact and fiction, and who we are. Mr. Hwang talks about Yellow Face at this event. [http://onlinecourses.colgate.edu/livingwriters]

In 2008, it was revealed that ''Yellow Face'' gave Hwang his third Obie Award in Playwriting and made him a third-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

The play is currently published by [[Theatre Communications Group]] and in an acting edition by [[Dramatists Play Service]], Inc.

==Plot summary==

When the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' transferred from London to New York City, there was a [[Miss_Saigon#Controversy|controversy]] over the casting of [[Jonathan Pryce]], a white British actor, in an Asian role.  Although Hwang receives a lot of publicity about his protests against the casting, particularly as the first Asian-American playwright to win a Tony (for ''[[M. Butterfly]]''), the production of ''Miss Saigon'' continues without changes to the cast.  In the play ''Yellow Face'', the character Hwang accidentally casts a white man, Marcus G. Dahlman, as an Asian in one of the leading roles of ''Face Value''.  Comedy ensues as Hwang is first convinced and then tries to convince other people that Marcus has Asian ancestry as a Jew from Siberia.  Hwang realizes that Marcus has no Asian blood, but by then, ''Face Value'' has cost $2 million and Hwang tries to cover up his mistake.  Marcus, however, continues playing his role as an Asian in all parts of his life, becoming an activist for Asian rights, angering Hwang who views him as an &quot;ethnic tourist.&quot; The play further explores his relationship to his father and that of the Chinese community to America. The father is a successful immigrant who built a large bank in California, and after some political contributions, gets investigated by Sen. [[Fred Thompson]] as a Chinese who funnels money from China to influence American politics. The investigations bears resemblance to that of [[Wen Ho Lee]]. In the course of this, the protagonist and Marcus get implicated as Chinese collaborators.  As Marcus' true identity reveals him as Caucasian, Thompsons's investigation breaks down, but Hwang now has to come clean about Marcus, and about himself.

==Production history==
''Ruined'' was commissioned by the [[Goodman Theatre]] (Chicago, Illinois) and is a co-production with the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]. Nottage and director [[Kate Whoriskey]] traveled to Uganda to interview women as background for the play, which first was performed in 2007 in the Goodman Theatre New Stages Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodmantheatre.org/News/PressRoom/Releases/101608_RuinedRelease.aspx News Release, Ruined]''Goodman Theatre'', October 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The play premiered in November 2008 at the Goodman Theatre and ran through December 7. It opened off-Broadway at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]], New York City Center – Stage I in previews on January 21, 2009, and officially on February 10, 2009. The production closed on September 6, 2009 after receiving nine extensions.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/128784-Pulitzer_Winner_Ruined_Gets_Six_Extra_Weeks_at_MTC Pulitzer Winner Ruined Gets Six Extra Weeks at MTC&quot;], playbill.com, April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones, Tom Mardirosian, Ron McBee, Simon Shabantu Kashama and Saidah Arrika Ekulona (Mama Nadi) who left the production in May 2009 and was replaced by Portia. Scenic design was by [[Derek McLane]], costume design by [[Paul Tazewell]], lighting design by [[Peter Kaczorowski]], sound design by Rob Milburn and Michael Bodeen, and original music by Dominic Kanza with lyrics by Lynn Nottage.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126205-After_a_Raft_of_Raves_Ruined_Gets_Two-Week_Extension_in_NYC After a Raft of Raves, Ruined Gets Two-Week Extension in NYC&quot;], playbill.com, February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It ran at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]] through April 30, 2011.

==Critical response==
[[Ben Brantley]] in his ''[[The New York Times]]'' review, wrote: &quot;Ms. Nottage, the wide-ranging and increasingly confident author of ''Intimate Apparel'' and ''Fabulation or, the Re-Education of Undine'', hooks her audience with promises of a conventionally structured, purposefully plotted play, stocked with sympathetic characters and informative topical detail. She delivers on those promises. Yet a raw and genuine agony pulses within and finally bursts through this sturdy framework, giving ''Ruined'' an impact that lingers beyond its well-shaped, sentimental ending. . . . Ms. Nottage has endowed the frail-looking Sophie, as well as the formidable Mama, with a strength that transforms this tale of ruin into a clear-eyed celebration of endurance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/theater/reviews/11bran.html?pagewanted=1 &quot;Theatre Review: War’s Terrors, Through a Brothel Window&quot;,]''The New York Times'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Civilians''' is an investigative [[theatre company]] in [[New York City]] founded in 2001 by Artistic Director [[Steve Cosson]]. The Civilians artists pursue their inquiries using interviews, community residencies, research, and other methods.&lt;ref&gt;Grode, Eric. [http://nymag.com/arts/all/indie/52576 “Big Ideas, Small Stages,” ''New York Magazine'' (November 30, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; Working with a combination of journalism and art, The Civilians creates theatrical events that seek to promote an inquisitions of current issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Garrett. [http://stage-directions.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1056&amp;Itemid=75 “Social Work,” ''Stage Directions'' (September 8, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has createdseven original plays. According to ''Variety Magazine'', The Civilians &quot;travels far and wide researching a piece around a given subject, conducting interviews and comparing notes along the way, sometimes for years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;Thielman, Sam. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_080328_variety.html “Civilians Take Unique Approach,” ''Variety'' (March 28, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company history ==
Artistic Director Steve Cosson founded the company in 2001, with a multi-disciplinary group of artists including some fellow [[University of California-San Diego]] graduates, as “a breeding ground for new styles of collaboration”&lt;ref&gt;Estvanik, Nicole. [http://thecivilians-press.blogspot.com/2004_12_01_archive.html &quot;'''The Civilians''' What do You Believe?&quot; ''American Theatre Magazine'' (December 2004).]&lt;/ref&gt; Inspiration was taken from the British [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]], Cosson having studied under director and Joint Stock member [[Les Waters]] at UCSD.&lt;ref&gt;LaBelle, Devon. [http://www.actorstheatre.org/HUMANA%20FESTIVAL%20CDROM/humana_thisbeautifulcity.pdf. &quot;The Civilians&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cosson has said “I wanted to create a theatre that would engage with larger social, cultural, and political realities through the eyes of real, ordinary people, or 'civilians.'”&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Kirsten. [http://www.amrep.org/articles/4_4b/civilians.html &quot;The Civilians Have a Few Questions for YOU!&quot; ''American Repertory Theater'' (April, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this goal, the name of the company was derived from a [[vaudeville]] term for those not within the vaudeville community.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Garrett. [http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37205087/Social-Work. &quot;Social Work&quot; ''Stage Directions'' (September 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding in 2001, The Civilians’ projects have been produced at venues throughout [[New York City]], including [[The Public Theater]], [[Joe's Pub]], [[St. Ann's Warehouse]], [[59E59 Theaters]], and the [[Vineyard Theatre]], and at theaters nationally, including The [[Center Theatre Group]] (at the [[Mark Taper Forum]]), [[Studio Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Studio Theatre]], [[A.R.T.]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}}, [[La Jolla Playhouse]], HBO’s [[U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]], and [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]. Works by the company have also toured nationally and internationally to universities, arts presenters and festivals.

The Civilians made its UK debut with ''Gone Missing'' in 2004 at the [[Gate Theatre]], and ''(I Am) Nobody’s Lunch'' was a [[Fringe First Award]] winner at the 2006 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], leading to a London production at the [[Soho Theatre]]. The Civilians’ commercial run of ''Gone Missing'' at the [[Barrow Street Theatre]] ran for seven months and was included in several Top 10 of 2007 lists in the New York press, including critic Charles Isherwood’s list in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Ernio. &quot;Best In Show: ''August'', ''Dividing the Estate'' and ''Gypsy'' Top 2007 &quot;Best of&quot; Lists,&quot; Playbill (January 4, 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the successful productions, The Civilians’ work has been published in a number of formats. ''Gone Missing'' was published by [[Dramatists Play Service]] in 2009, following its inclusion in the publication of ''(I Am) Nobody’s Lunch'' by [[Oberon Books]] in 2007. In 2009, [[Playscripts, Inc.]] published an anthology of all of the Civilians' works to date, excluding ''This Beautiful City'', which was still running at The Vineyard Theater. Additionally, an original cast recording of ''Gone Missing'' was released by [[Ghostlight Records]] in 2008.

== Structure ==
According to The Civilians' website:

{{blockquote|The artistic foundation of The Civilians is a group of Associate Artists including directors, writers, actors, designers, choreographers, and composers. Each year, the company invites several artists to join as new Associate Artists. The company realizes its projects through a network of collaborative partnerships. Many projects are developed with the support of partners including universities, institutional theaters and artist residency programs. Projects often tour to both performing arts presenters and regional theaters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Company,&quot; The Civilians' official website.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Works ==

=== Canard, Canard, Goose? (2002) ===
''Canard, Canard, Goose?'' was the company’s first production, premiering in 2002 at [[HERE Arts Center]] in New York City. The play was devised and created by the company, directed by Steve Cosson, with music and lyrics by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosson, Steven. &quot;Canard, Canard, Goose?.&quot; ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The play deals with &quot;rumors of maltreated geese during the making of ''[[Fly Away Home]]'', the sentimental 1996 Disney motion picture that featured [[Anna Paquin]] leading geese south in an ultra-light plane.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Out&quot;&gt;Cote, David. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_2002_tony.html “Reviews: Canard, Canard, Goose?” ''Time Out New York'' (February 7, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Time Out: New York'', &quot;The middle part of the show includes funny but affectionate impersonations of the eccentric and lonely folks who live in that remote hamlet. After two days of interviews, however, the group discovers that ''Fly Away Home'' was actually filmed in Ontario. Songs and silly dances are interspersed among the members' increasingly desperate updates on their deteriorating investigation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Out&quot; /&gt;

=== The Ladies (2004) ===
''The Ladies'' was written by [[Anne Washburn]] and directed by [[Anne Kauffman]], both Associate Artists of the company. The play presents the characters of [[Eva Peron]], [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Elena Ceausescu]], and [[Jiang Qing]], as well as the artists themselves. It premiered at [[Dixon Place]] in New York City in 2004.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Paris Commune (2004, 2008) ===
''Paris Commune'' tells the story of the [[Paris Commune|Parisian uprising of 1871]], the first socialist rebellion in Europe. The piece was developed as a part of [[La Jolla Playhouse]]’s Page-to-Stage program in 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;dePoyen&quot;&gt;de Poyen, Jennifer. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_040730_sduniontrib.html “Rebels with a Cause,” ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' (July 30, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; and further expanded in 2008 as a part of the Public Lab Series Workshop at the Public Theater.&lt;ref&gt;English, Sandy. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_080604_socialist.html “A Turn Toward History We Need: ''Paris Commune'' at the Public Theater in New York” World Socialist website (June 4, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is unique among The Civilians’ early repertoire in that it was not developed through first-person interviews with those directly affected by the topic of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Fark, Bill. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_040722_nctimes.html &quot;Playhouse Workshops New Musical on 19th Century French Commune,&quot; ''North County Times'' (July 22, 2004).]&lt;/ref&gt; but rather through extensive historical research into the actual[[Paris Commune]] that had its genesis in the 1871 rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;dePoyen&quot; /&gt; The play was written by Steve Cosson and all of the music was written or adapted by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosson, Steven. &quot;Paris Commune.&quot; ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. (New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (I am) Nobody’s Lunch (2006) ===
[[(I Am) Nobody's Lunch]] premiered at [[59E59 Theaters]] in New York City in 2006 and received its London premiere at the Soho Theatre later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Civilians: An Anthology of Six Plays'' (Playscripts, Inc., 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier draft of the piece was first performed in 2004 as [[PS 122]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Zinoman, Jason. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_060129_nytimes.html “They Feel a Homeland Security Song Coming On,” ''The New York Times'' (January 29, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Isherwood of ''The New York Times'' “How and why we come to believe what we believe is the large question being explored with a wink in this collage of material culled from interviews with an odd assortment of Americans, ranging from soldiers standing vigil at [[Grand Central Terminal]] to a fellow who believes his body is inhabited by a celestial being who has useful tips on dispelling the fog of fear that has enveloped the country since [[9/11]].”&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_060123_nytimes.html “A Funny and Sad Look at Facts, Myths and Spin,” ''The New York Times'' (January 23, 2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; The piece received a coveted Fringe First award at the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eaton&quot; /&gt; ''(I am) Nobody’s Lunch'' was written and directed by Steve Cosson based on interviews conducted by the cast, with music and lyrics by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosson, Steven. ''(I am) Nobody's Lunch''. ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. (New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gone Missing (2007) ===
{{main|Gone Missing (play)}}
''Gone Missing'' premiered in 2007 at the [[Barrow Street Theatre]] in New York City. It is composed of extensive interviews by the company, all focused on the idea of loss, in many of its myriad forms. According to ''The New York Times'' review of the production, &quot;Underneath its wry surface lies a mournful acknowledgment of the transience of life’s pleasures, symbolized here by any number of cherished possessions that somehow fell into a black hole, leaving behind an aching void in the shape of a bit of jewelry, a [[PalmPilot]] or a stuffed animal. . . . Even the most mundane and functional items can be a source of strange comfort, a talisman of achievement, a thing to cling to when life gets you down,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles. [http://www.thecivilians.org/news_070627_nytimes.html “Checking the Lost and Found of Life,” ''The New York Times'' (June 27, 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gone Missing'' was written and directed by Steve Cosson based on interviews conducted by the company, with music and lyrics written by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]], and additional text from &quot;Interview with Dr. Palinurus&quot; by Peter Morris.&lt;ref&gt;Cosson, Steven. &quot;Gone Missing.&quot; ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. (New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008.).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shadow of Himself (2008) ===
''Shadow of Himself'' was written in 2008 by playwright Neal Bell. He wrote the play by commission from The Civilians, with the support of [[The Public Theater]] and The Orchard Project, collaborating with the actors and taking inspiration from interviews done by the company.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Neal. &quot;Shadow of Himself&quot; ''The Civilians''. Ed. Steven Cosson. (New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008.).&lt;/ref&gt; The piece opened at the Access Theatre in New York City in January 2009, produced by [[Rabbit Hole Ensemble]]. The play is a retelling of the Gilgamesh Epic.&lt;ref&gt;Genzlinger, Neil. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/theater/reviews/23shad.html &quot;Two Friends Start a Journey, but One Will Not Return,&quot; ''The New York Times'' (January 23, 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== This Beautiful City (2008) ===
{{main|This Beautiful City (play)}}

'''Cherlynne Theresa &quot;Lynne&quot; Thigpen''' (December 22, 1948 – March 12, 2003) was an American stage and television [[actress]], best known for her role as &quot;The Chief&quot; in the various [[Carmen Sandiego]] television series.

==Early life==
Thigpen was born in [[Joliet, Illinois]], and obtained a degree in teaching. She taught English in high school briefly while studying theatre and dance at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]. Thigpen moved to [[New York City]] in 1971 to begin her career as a [[stage actress]].

==Career==
===Theatre===
Thigpen had a long and prolific [[theater]] career, and appeared in numerous [[musical theater|musicals]] including ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[The Night That Made America Famous]]'', ''[[The Magic Show]]'', ''[[Working (musical)|Working]]'', ''[[Tintypes]]'' and ''An American Daughter'' (for which she won her [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play|Tony Award]] for her portrayal of Dr. Judith Kaufman in 1997) .

===Film===
Her first [[film|feature film]] role was Lynne in ''[[Godspell (film)|Godspell]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]), co-starring opposite [[Victor Garber]] and [[David Haskell]]. She appeared notably as the [[omniscient]] Radio DJ in ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', and as Leonna Barrett, the mother of an expelled student in ''[[Lean on Me (film)|Lean on Me]]'', a story of famous American principal [[Joe Louis Clark]]. She had a role in ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'', alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], as Carla Howard, the murder victim's mother. She also played the Second President of the world council in ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]). Her last film was ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]) starring [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] (which was released only a month following her death and paid tribute to her in the end credits).

===Television===
Thigpen was perhaps best known for playing Luna in the television show, ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' as well as &quot;[[Characters and sketches on Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?#The Chief|The Chief]]&quot; of the [[ACME and V.I.L.E.|ACME]] Detective Agency in the long-running [[PBS Kids|PBS children's]] [[geography]] [[game show]] ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', which involves both education and comedy, and, on occasion, musical performance. She remained The Chief in the successor show, ''[[Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', but of ACME Time Net. She also appeared in many other television series during her career, most notably in a recurring role as [[List of All My Children characters#Grace Keefer|Grace Keefer]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime drama ''[[All My Children]]'' and a supporting role as [[The District#Cast|Ella Mae Farmer]], a statistics clerk for the [[Washington, D.C.]] police department, on the [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The District]]''. She guest-starred in episodes of ''[[Gimme A Break!]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', and ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]]''.

===Radio===
She appeared in radio skits of the [[Garrison Keillor]] program ''[[The American Radio Company of the Air]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/hodgepodge/25anniversary/timeline.htm |title=A Prairie Home Companion Timeline |publisher=Prairiehome.publicradio.org |date=1974-07-06 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice was also heard on over 20 audio books, primarily works with socially relevant themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/tributes/lynne_thigpen.shtml |title=Muppet Central Articles - Tributes: Lynne Thigpen |publisher=Muppetcentral.com |date=2003-03-13 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Thigpen died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on March 12, 2003 in her [[Marina del Rey, California]] home. Thigpen had been complaining of headaches within the final days of her life. Drugs and foul play were ruled out by the coroner's autopsy, which found &quot;acute cardiac dysfunction, non-traumatic systemic and spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage and hemorrhage in the brain.&quot; Thigpen was interred at Elmhurst Cemetery in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois.

===Response and legacy===
When Thigpen died, the third season finale of ''The District'' had a tribute to her character, Ella Mae Farmer. Thigpen's death led to a four-year [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] of ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A planned film version of ''Bear'' was also put on hold. Two years after Thigpen's death, Tara Mooney interviewed with ''Bear'' star [[Ray D'Arcy]] on [[Today FM]] stated: &quot;The crew's hearts just weren't in it anymore&quot;.  Thigpen's friends and family established a non-profit foundation, '''The Lynne Thigpen - Bobo Lewis Foundation,''' to help young actors and actresses learn how to survive and succeed in New York theater and to mentor the next generation of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars.

Thigpen was posthumously nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for voicing Luna the moon in ''Bear in the Big Blue House,'' but lost to [[Jeff Corwin]].  Her final film, ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' was dedicated in her memory.  Also, an elementary school in her hometown was named in her honor.

'''Philip “Fyvush” Finkel''' (born October 9, 1922) is an American actor best known as a star of [[Yiddish theater]] and for his role as lawyer Douglas Wambaugh on the [[television series]] ''[[Picket Fences]]'', for which he earned an [[Emmy Award]] in 1994.  He is also known for his portrayal of Harvey Lipschultz, a crotchety  [[U.S. history]] teacher, on the TV series ''[[Boston Public]]''.

== Early life and career ==
Finkel was born at home in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of [[Brooklyn]], New York City, the third of four sons of Jewish [[immigrant]] tailor Harry Finkel, from [[Warsaw, Poland]], and housewife Mary, from [[Minsk]], then part of [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=newsday&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/fanfare/ny-fffast5523174jan06,0,2153374.story &quot;Fast Chat: Fyvush Finkel&quot; (interview), ''[[Newsday]]'', January 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--If Newsday articles goes into pa-archive, here is mirror site: http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/52916/fyvush-finkel-the-face-that-launched-a-thousand-shticks/ --&gt; Born '''Philip Finkel''', with no middle name, he adopted the stage name &quot;Fyvush,&quot; a common [[Yiddish]] given name.&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;

Finkel first appeared on the stage at age 9, and acted for almost 35 years in the thriving [[Yiddish]] theaters of the [[Yiddish Theater District]] of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], as well as performing as a [[standup comic]] in the Catskill's [[Borscht Belt]]. In 2008 he recalled that,
{{cquote|I played child parts till I was 14, 15, then my voice changed. So I decided to learn a trade and went to a vocational high school in New York. I studied to be a furrier, but I never worked at it. As soon as I graduated high school, I went to a stock company in Pittsburgh, a Jewish theater, and I played there for 38 weeks, and that's where I actually learned my trade a little bit as an adult.&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;}}

He worked regularly until the ethnic venues began dying out in the early 1960s, then made his [[Broadway theatre]] debut in the original 1964 production of the [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', joining the cast as Mordcha, the innkeeper, in 1965.&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/productionreplacements.asp?ID=3213 Internet Broadway Database: ''Fiddler on the Roof'' Replacements/Transfers]&lt;/ref&gt; The production ran through July 2, 1972. Finkel then played Lazar Wolf, the butcher, in the limited run 1981 Broadway revival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13312 Internet Broadway Database: ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1981 revival)]&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually played the lead role of Tevye the milkman for years&lt;ref 
name=newsday /&gt; in the national touring company.

Shortly afterward, Finkel succeeded [[Hy Anzell]] in the role of Mr. Mushnik in the [[Off-Broadway]] musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theaterdb.com/QShow.php?sid=s2190 Internet Theatre Database: ''Little Shop of Horrors'']&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1988, Finkel's work as &quot;Sam&quot; in the New York [[Shakespeare]] Festival revival of the Yiddish classic ''Cafe Crown''  earned him an [[Obie Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153597.html Infoplease: 1988–1989 Obie Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Drama Desk]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|id=86560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Finkel made his movie debut in the English-subtitled, Yiddish sketch-comedy revue ''Monticello, Here We Come'' (1950), then after small parts in an episode of the [[television series]] ''[[Kojak]]'' in 1977 and the [[miniseries]] ''Evergreen'' in 1985, returned to film in the detective comedy ''Off Beat'' (1986).  That same year saw a role opposite [[Robin Williams]] in a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Playhouse]]'' adaptation of [[Saul Bellow]]'s novel ''[[Seize the Day (novel)|Seize the Day]]'', and a role in the film adaptation of [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway comedy ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]''. An appearance as a lawyer in director [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''Q &amp; A'' (1990) led TV producer-writer [[David E. Kelley]] to cast Finkel as public defender Douglas Wambaugh in the television series ''[[Picket Fences]]'' ([[CBS]], 1992–1996). For the role, Finkel earned a 1994 [[Emmy Award]], announcing at the televised ceremonies that he had waited 51 years for that moment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Following the end of ''Picket Fences'', Finkel had a regular role on the short-lived revival of ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 1998) and then reteamed with writer-producer Kelley to play history teacher Harvey Lipschultz in ''[[Boston Public]]'' ([[Fox Broadcasting|Fox]], 2000–2004).

Through the 1990s and 2000s, Finkel has appeared in movies including ''Nixon'' and ''The Crew'', guested on TV series including ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Early Edition]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', and provided voiceovers for episodes of the [[animated series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (&quot;[[Lisa's Sax]]&quot;) and ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' (&quot;Ickis! You'll Be Snorched!&quot;) and the animated direct-to-video feature ''[[The Brave Little Toaster|The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''.  In 2009, he appeared in the [[Coen brothers]]' film ''[[A Serious Man]]''. Most recently he had a guest appearance in ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'' (&quot;[[Men In Black]]&quot;)

'''Harold V.

Gould acted in film and television for nearly 50 years, appearing in more than 300 television shows, 20 major motion pictures, and over 100 stage plays, and received [[Emmy Award]] nominations five times.&lt;ref name=&quot;albany&quot;&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/writers.inst/gould_harold.html Harold Gould], New York State Writers Institute. Retrieved on 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for playing elegant, well-dressed men (as in ''[[The Sting]]''), and he regularly played Jewish characters and grandfather-type figures on television and film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Early life==
Gould was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Schenectady, New York]] to Louis and Lillian Goldstein. Louis was a postal worker, and Lillian was a homemaker who did part-time work for the state health department. Gould was raised in [[Colonie, New York]] and was [[valedictorian]] of his high school class. He enrolled at Albany Teachers College upon graduation (now known as [[University at Albany, The State University of New York|University at Albany, SUNY]]), and studied to become a social studies or English teacher.

After two years in college, Gould enlisted in the [[United States Army]], during [[World War II]], and saw combat in [[France]] in a [[chemical mortar battalion|mortar company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;albany&quot;/&gt; He developed [[immersion foot|trenchfoot]], and was sent to England to recover. After convalescence, Gould served in a [[rail transport]] unit in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;what&quot;&gt;[http://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=982796220 Harold Gould], What A Character!. Retrieved on 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Gould returned to Albany Teachers College to study drama, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmbug&quot;&gt;[http://www.filmbug.com/db/292690  Harold Gould @ Filmbug], Misja.com, retrieved on 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He performed in [[summer stock theatre]] on [[Cape Cod]], then decided to enroll at [[Cornell University]] to study drama and speech. Gould earned a master of arts degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. in theatre in 1953 from Cornell, and also met his future wife, Lea Vernon.

==Career==
Upon graduation, Gould accepted a position at [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], where he spent three years teaching and doing stage work.&lt;ref name=&quot;what&quot;/&gt; He made his professional theatre debut in 1955 as [[Thomas Jefferson]] in ''The Common Glory'' in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800012754/bio Harold Gould biography], Yahoo! Movies. Retrieved on 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Gould was offered a professorship in the drama department at the [[University of California, Riverside]],&lt;ref name=&quot;filmbug&quot;/&gt; which he accepted. He taught there until 1960, when he decided to try professional acting himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;what&quot;/&gt; He had difficulty finding acting jobs at first, and had to take work as a security guard and as a part-time acting teacher at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;albany&quot;/&gt;

Gould made his film debut in ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' but was not credited for his work; his first credited role was a small part in ''The Coach'' in 1962. He gradually found more work and got roles in ''[[The Yellow Canary]]'', a [[Rod Serling]] movie with [[Pat Boone]], [[Jack Klugman]], and [[Barbara Eden]]; ''[[The Satan Bug]]''; ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]''; and ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]].

Gould worked steadily in television in the 1960s and early 1970s, including roles in ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare#Television|Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'', ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''. Gould originated the role of [[Marlo Thomas]]'s father Lou in the 1965 pilot for ''[[That Girl]]'', but the series role went to Lew Parker. He appeared in ''[[The Long Hot Summer (TV series)|The Long, Hot Summer]]''  and ''[[He and She]]'', two short-lived television series. Gould also acted in a [[Television pilot|pilot]], later broadcast as a 1972 episode of ''[[Love, American Style]]'' titled &quot;Love and the Happy Days&quot; as Howard Cunningham, the frustrated father of a young man named [[Richie Cunningham]] (played by [[Ron Howard]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; &gt;Hal Erickson, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=27975&amp;mod=bio Harold Gould biography]. Allmovie excerpt published in the [[New York Times]]. Retrieved on 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] turned that episode into a series called ''[[Happy Days]]'', Gould was tabbed to reprise the Howard Cunningham role. However when production was delayed, he went abroad to perform in a play. Midway through the play's run, after learning ''Happy Days'' was ready to begin shooting, he decided to honor his commitment to the stage production and passed on the part, which led to [[Tom Bosley]] being cast as the family patriarch. Gould would later state that a requirement to shave his beard was also a factor in his declining the role.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, Dennis. [http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-harold-gould-20100914,0,1952380.story Harold Gould obituary], ''Los Angeles Times'', 14 September 2010 (retrieved 14 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould had worked in television and film for almost fifteen years before his career really took off with his portrayal of Kid Twist in ''[[The Sting]]''. He appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Love and Death]]'', as a villain in ''[[Silent Movie]]'' (directed by [[Mel Brooks]]), and made guest appearances on television shows such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''.  On ''Soap'' Gould played the hospital roommate of the character Jody ([[Billy Crystal]]) who has suicidal feelings while deciding whether or not to undergo a sex change. Gould's character sometimes refers to Jody as a 'fagela', which is [[Yiddish]] for a gay man.
[[File:Harold Gould Martin Morgenstern Mary Tyler Moore 1973.jpg|thumb|200px|Gould as Martin Morgenstern on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in 1973.]]
In 1972, Gould was cast as Martin Morgenstern, the father of Mary's best friend Rhoda, in an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. He reprised the role the following year and was hired as a regular when ''[[Rhoda]]'' was made into a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] in 1974. After ''Rhoda'' ended, Gould appeared in short-lived series such as the 1977 series ''The Feather and Father Gang'', where he starred as Harry Danton, a smooth-talking ex-con man, with [[Stefanie Powers]] as Toni &quot;Feather&quot; Danton, his daughter and a hard-working, successful lawyer. It ran for 13 episodes.

He also appeared in the miniseries ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]''. In the 1980 NBC miniseries ''[[Moviola]]'', he portrayed [[Louis B. Mayer]] and gained an [[Emmy]] nomination. He appeared as [[Chad Lowe]]'s grandfather in ''[[Spencer (TV series)|Spencer]]'', and played a Jewish widower wooing the Christian [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry]]''. Other roles included a married man having an affair with another member of his [[Yiddish|Yiddish-speaking]] club in an episode of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''The Sunset Years'', and as the owner of a deli grooming two African-American men to inherit his business in ''[[Singer &amp; Sons]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;/&gt; Gould received [[Emmy award|Emmy]] nominations for his roles in ''Rhoda'', ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' and ''Moviola''.

Gould played Miles Webber, the steadfast boyfriend of [[Rose Nylund]] ([[Betty White]]) on the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' (he also played a different boyfriend of Rose's named Arnie in the show's first season). He portrayed the father of a villain called The Prankster on ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and made guest appearances on television series such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Judging Amy]]''. Gould's film roles in the 1990s and 2000s include appearances in ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'', ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'', ''[[Master of Disguise]]'',  the [[2003 in film|2003]] remake of ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', ''[[Nobody's Perfect (2004 film)|Nobody's Perfect]]'', and ''[[Whisper of the Heart (film)|Whisper of the Heart]]''.

His stage credits include [[Broadway theatre]] plays such as [[Jules Feiffer]]'s ''Grown Ups'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Fools (play)|Fools]]'', Richard Baer's ''Mixed Emotions'', and [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''Artist Descending a Staircase''. Gould won an [[Obie Award]] in 1969 for his work in ''The Increased Difficulty of Concentration'', written by [[Václav Havel]], and reprised the role for a 1988 PBS version of the play.&lt;ref name=&quot;albany&quot;/&gt;  Gould was an early and longtime (48 years) member of [[Theatre West]], the oldest membership theatre company in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;http://theatrewest.org/company.html&lt;/ref&gt; He played Mr. Green in [[Jeff Baron]]'s ''[[Visiting Mr. Green]]&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7972">'''Eugene V. &quot;Gene&quot; Frankel''' (December 23, 1919 &amp;ndash; April 20, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] actor, theater director, and acting teacher especially notable in the founding of the off-Broadway scene. Frankel served in the Army during World War II in entertainment and as a member of an aerial crew.

==Life and career==
Frankel's direction of the off-Broadway production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks]]'' was regarded as a crucial production in promoting African-American theater during the civil-rights movement which opened in 1961 and ran for more than 1,400 performances at the St. Mark's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2008/12/clip_job_mailer_3.php ''Village Voice'' May 11, 1961, Vol. VI, No. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast included James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Browne, Louis Gossett, Cicely Tyson, Godfrey Cambridge, Maya Angelou and Charles Gordone.

He began his own career as an actor and was one of the earliest members of the [[Actors Studio]]. He moved behind the scenes and became a theater director on and off Broadway. His most notable Broadway production was [[Arthur Kopit]]'s ''[[Indians (play)|Indians]]'' starring [[Stacy Keach]], who won the 1970 [[Tony Award]] as Best Actor for his portrayal of [[Buffalo Bill]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/08/john_lahr_digs.php ''Village Voice'' October 16, 1969, Vol. XIV, No. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was also nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for best play of 1970. 

His other Broadway productions included ''A Cry of Players'' (1968), [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Lost in the Stars]]'' (1972) and [[Harry Chapin]]'s ''[[The Night That Made America Famous]]'' (1975).  His off-Broadway productions included ''Brecht on Brecht'', (starring [[Viveca Lindfors]], [[Lotte Lenya]], [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Anne Jackson]]), and ''[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]'' starring [[Cicely Tyson]].  He directed an [[Arthur Miller]] play when Miller was married to [[Marilyn Monroe]].

==Gene Frankel Theatre==
As well as directing over 200 shows and managing at least twelve theaters throughout his career, Frankel taught acting, writing and directing. His last stage was the ''Gene Frankel Theatre and Film Workshop'' at 24 Bond Street in Greenwich Village. Frankel said that the heart of successful acting was, ''Truth. I don't let my actors tell lies. The camera doesn't lie, the stage doesn't let you lie.''  {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He was a visiting professor in theater at various institutions of higher learning including [[Columbia University]], [[Boston College]], and [[New York University]]. 

On August 4, 1973, his [[Mercer Arts Center]], a complex of seven small theaters, which had been located on the first two floors of the residential Broadway Central Hotel, physically collapsed. Frankel, who had been conducting a rehearsal at the time, noticed the ceiling and walls beginning to buckle and heroically led the actors and several residents to safety; five people died in the collapse. &lt;ref&gt;NY Daily News, p. 1, Saturday, August 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;NY Post, p. 1, Saturday, August 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;NY Times, pp. 13–15, Saturday, August 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only his last theater was a financial success, serving as home to artistic director Christopher Groenwald's New Mercury Players and as a satellite location for artistic director Marilyn Majeski's &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=158662722 Marilyn Majeski obituary], Boston Globe, July 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Grove Street Playhouse. 

===Gail Thacker===
In 2003 Gene Frankel made Gail Thacker&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/villager_300/channelingicons.html &quot;Channeling icon’s spirit while trying to pay the rent&quot;]. Monica Uszerowicz, The Villager, Volume 78, Number 35, January 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; - February 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director of The Gene Frankel Theatre and Film Workshop at the Bond Street location. Upon Gene Frankel's death his legacy passed into Thacker's trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E5D71731F931A15757C0A9639C8B63 &quot;Gene Frankel, Acting Coach And Director, Is Dead at 85&quot;].

===August Strindberg Repertory Theatre===
{{Main|August Strindberg Repertory Theatre}}
The August Strindberg Repertory Theatre became the resident company at the Gene Frankel Theatre when it transferred its first production, a co-production with the Negro Ensemble Company of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg's]] ''Playing with Fire'', there in June 2012 after an initial run at the [[New School for Drama|New School]]'s theater. It has since produced a double bill (''Casper's Fat Tuesday'' and ''[[The Stronger]]'') and ''[[Easter (play)|Easter]]''. &quot;Casper's Fat Tuesday&quot; was a co-production with the Pink Pig Ballet.

==Family==
Frankel had two children, Laura Frankel and Ethan Frankel, from his marriage which ended in divorce.  He was survived by his daughter, Laura Frankel. His son, an aspiring actor, who studied at his father's school had struggled with marijuana use and psychiatric illness which led him to leap off the top of a 17-floor-building during 1995 in Manhattan during a psychosis from which he miraculously survived.  After a lengthy coma and therapy to learn to walk again Ethan was placed in a group home in the Bronx where he was murdered by a fellow resident the following year.  Frankel created a scholarship at his theater in his son's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily News&quot;&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/04/1997-04-04_real-life_tragedy_for_acting.html Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Frankel was awarded the first [[Obie Award]] for directing, with his production of ''[[Volpone]]'' (1958) and then won two more also for directing. He also received the first Lola d'Annunzi and Vernon Rice awards for outstanding achievement in theater.

The '''Obie Awards''' or '''Off-Broadway Theater Awards''' are annual awards given by  ''[[The Village Voice]]'' newspaper to theatre artists and groups in New York City. As the [[Tony Awards]] cover [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions, the Obies cover [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] productions.

==Background==
The Obie Awards were initiated by Edwin (Ed) Fancher, publisher of ''The Village Voice,'' who handled the financing and business side of the project. They were first given in 1956 under the direction of theater critic Jerry Tallmer. Initially, only Off-Broadway productions were eligible; in 1964, Off-Off-Broadway productions were made eligible.

==Award structure==
With the exception of the Lifetime Achievement and Best New American Play awards, there are no fixed categories and the winning actors and actresses are in a single category titled &quot;Performance&quot;. There are no announced nominations.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/ruined-wins-obie-awards/ &quot;'Ruined' Wins Obie Awards&quot;] ''The New York Times'', May 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

Not every category is awarded every year.  ''The Village Voice'' also awards annual Obie grants to selected companies; in 2011, these grants were $2,000 each to [[Metropolitan Playhouse]] and Wakka Wakka.&lt;ref name=play1&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150893-Chad-Deity-Ethan-Hawke-Laurie-Metcalf-Thomas-Sadoski-Charlayne-Woodard-Win-Obie-Awards &quot; 'Chad Deity', Ethan Hawke, Laurie Metcalf, Thomas Sadoski, Charlayne Woodard Win Obie Awards&quot;] playbill.com, May 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Ross Wetzsteon Grant, named after its former theater editor, in the amount of $2,000 (in 2009; in 2011 the grant was $1,000), for a theatre that nurtures innovative new plays.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Gordon.[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003900.html?categoryId=15&amp;cs=1 Off Broadway event] ''Variety'', May 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The first awards in 1955-1956 for plays and musicals were given to ''Absalom'' (Lionel Abel) as Best New Play, ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', Best All-Around Production and ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' as Best Musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153525.html &quot;1955–1956 Obie Awards&quot;] infoplease.com, accessed May 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards for Off-Broadway theatre are the [[Lucille Lortel Awards]], the [[Drama Desk Awards]], the [[Drama League Award]], and the [[Outer Critics Circle Awards]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Race of the Ark Tattoo'' is an exploration of the nebulous territory between memories and dreams. It takes place not in a theater but in a flea market (installed in a gallery on the side of P.S.122).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curtainup.com/raceark.html CurtainUp.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Jordan was born in [[New York City]], to Robert Anson Jordan, Sr., from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and Constance Hand-Jordan, from New York.  His maternal grandfather was [[Learned Hand]], judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and one of the most respected jurists in the United States.  In 1942, when Jordan was five years old, his parents divorced.  His mother married [[Newbold Morris]], president of the [[New York City Council]].

Jordan&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 2, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following his graduation from [[Harvard University]] in 1958, Jordan began his acting career in earnest. In 1961, he appeared on Broadway with [[Art Carney]] and [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]''. He also began working in television productions, appearing in episodes of ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[Naked City]]'', ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'', and ''[[The Wide Country]]''. He performed with [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]] in productions of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]],'' and ''[[As You Like It]]''. In 1966, Jordan returned to Broadway, appearing in ''[[Generation]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]].  

Beginning in 1970, Jordan turned from television to feature film work.  He co-starred in [[Lawman (film)|''Lawman'']] (1971) and ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'' (1971) with [[Burt Lancaster]], and appeared opposite [[Robert Mitchum]] twice, in ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'' (1973), as the informant-Coyle's handler, a pragmatic U.S. Treasury agent; and in ''[[The Yakuza]]'' (1975) as the bodyguard of Mitchum's friend, George Tanner. He played a host of villains and mixed good guy-villains in films such as Hawk in [[Rooster Cogburn (film)|''Rooster Cogburn'']] (1975), ''[[Logan's Run (1976 film)|Logan's Run]]'' (1976), and ''Interiors'' (1978).

In ten episodes of the popular television series ''[[The Equalizer]]'' (1987–1988), he helped fill in while the star, [[Edward Woodward]], recovered from a heart attack.  Meanwhile, Jordan continued on the stage as well, winning an [[Obie]] award for his appearance in New York in the [[Czechs|Czech]] playwright [[Václav Havel]]'s ''[[A Private View]]'' (1983) and an [[L.A. Drama Critic's Award]] for directing another Havel play, ''[[Largo Desolato]]'' (1987).

In 1990, Jordan directed a production of ''Macbeth'' in New York City. He played national security advisor Jeffrey Pelt in ''The Hunt for Red October''.  He starred in a television production of ''Three Hotels'' (1991) and the 1991 &quot;Deadline&quot; episode of ''[[Tales from the Crypt]]''.  In ''[[Posse (1993 film)|Posse]]'' (1993), Jordan portrays Bates, a racist sheriff with his own plans for land on which the [[Negro]] town of Freemanville stands. 

His health began to fail and he was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]].

'''Anika Noni Rose''' (born September 6, 1972) is an [[United States|American]] singer and actress known for her [[Tony Award]]-winning performance in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Caroline, or Change]]'' and her starring roles in the films ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' and ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''.

== Early life ==
Rose was born in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/648191201.html?dids=648191201:648191201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+07%2C+2004&amp;author=FRANK+RIZZO%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=KILLER+PERFORMANCES+%3B+'AVENUE+Q%2C'+'WIFE%2C'+'ASSASSINS%2C'+PHYLICIA+RASHAD+TOP+WINNERS%3B+58TH+ANNUAL+TONY+AWARDS&amp;pqatl=google | work=Hartford Courant | title=Killer Performances ; 'Avenue Q,' 'Wife,' 'Assassins,' Phylicia Rashad Top Winners; 58Th Annual Tony Awards | first=Frank | last=Rizzo | date=2004-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her freshman year in high school, she appeared in a school production and caught the acting bug. She then attended [[Florida A&amp;M University]] where she earned a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in theatre, and started studying drama at the [[American Conservatory Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

== Career ==
Rose moved to New York without a job. After three months, she secured the role of Rusty in Broadway's ''[[Footloose (musical)|Footloose]]''. She followed ''Footloose'' with numerous workshops and two musicals using pre-existing song catalogs, ''[[Eli's Comin']]'' [[Off-Broadway]]&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, Les.[http://www.curtainup.com/eliscomin.html &quot;ACurtainUpReview:Eli's Comin'&quot;] Curtain Up.com, based on 5/2/01 performance, accessed September 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]'' with [[Lou Rawls]] in Philadelphia. Both of the full-scale tuners were rumored for transfers, but neither made it anywhere after their limited engagements ended. Rose's big Broadway break was getting cast as Emmie Thibodeaux in ''[[Caroline, or Change]]''. In 2004, she was awarded the Theatre World Award, the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Featured Actress, and the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical]] for ''Caroline, or Change''.

After her film debut, ''King of the Bingo Game'', she played the role of Kaya in ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'' in 2003 and she performed in ''[[Temptation (2004 film)|Temptation]]'' in 2004, followed by ''[[Surviving Christmas]]'' as a singer in the choir. In 2006, Rose starred in ''Dreamgirls'' as Lorrell Robinson with [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Eddie Murphy]]. Rose appeared in the films ''Just Add Water'', ''Razor'', and [[Disney]]'s 2009 animated feature ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', as the voice of the lead character [[Princess Tiana|Tiana]]; the character is Disney's first African-American princess. Rose hosted a hometown screening of ''The Princess and the Frog'' for children from the Charter Oak Cultural Center, a non-profit multi-cultural arts center that provides free after-school programs in Hartford, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/12/06/anika_noni_rose_assumes_mantle_as_disneys_first_black_princess/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Sarah | last=Rodman | title=Wearing the crown | date=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose also stars alongside [[Jill Scott]] in ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (TV series)|The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency]]'' directed by [[Anthony Minghella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kimberly Nordyke | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1d4af5a7ea85ee1bfce281f286d97805 | title=Rose lands 'Agency' role | date=2007-06-25 | accessdate=2007-06-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elżbieta Justyna Czyżewska''' (May 14, 1938&lt;ref&gt;Some sources such as [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=53822394 Find a Grave] and [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/18czyz.html ''The New York Times''] cite April 14, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; June 17, 2010) was a [[Poland|Polish]] actress active in both Poland and the United States.

==Early life==
Czyżewska was born in [[Warsaw]] in 1938. She attended the State Academy of Theatre in Warsaw and was advised by the Dean that in order to play leading roles in Romantic repertory she should undergo plastic surgery: to reduce the size of her breasts. Her answer, after she consulted her colleagues in the anti-establishment Student Satirical Theatre, was &quot;No way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishculture-nyc.org/elzbieta_czyzewska.htm/ Obituary (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first marriage was to the film director [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;!-- Marriage never confirmed --&gt; In 1965, she married the ''New York Times'' Warsaw correspondent, [[David Halberstam]]. She left Poland for the United States with him, but they divorced in 1977.

==Career in Poland==
At the peak of her film and theater career, and in trouble with the communist regime on account of her marriage to Halberstam - she was cast by the Polish director [[Andrzej Wajda]] in his film, ''Everything for Sale''. The young directors of the Polish new wave in cinema recognized their peer in breaking the conventions of superficial romantic comedy. In ''A Bride for the Australian'' (1963), ''Where is the General'' (1963) and ''Giuseppe in Warsaw'' (1964), Czyżewska created a character who was almost the reverse of the [[Cinderella]] versus [[Prince Charming]] formula, as it was her charm and wit that turned her suitors into ''her equals''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Not a &quot;method&quot; actor, she would never disappear into a character, nor would she, on the other hand, allow her striking persona to wholly define her succession of screen and theatre parts. [[Wojciech Has]] directed her performance in ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript (film)|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (1964). {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Besides the theater role that won her the major Golden Mask Award, Czyżewska had her most significant stage success in the Teatr Dramatyczny's 1965 production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]''. By now internationally recognized (from [[Moscow]] to [[San Salvador]]) as one of Poland's top young actors, {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} she expanded her artistic range in two film dramas: ''Unloved'' (1965) and Wajda's ''Everything for Sale'' (1968). The dark mood of both these movies marked the country's disillusionment after a brief period of cultural &quot;thaw&quot;. ''Unloved'', set shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]], tells the story of a young Jewish woman's love affair whose ending coincides with the ominous atmosphere of the period, including its anti-Semitism. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

She became an outcast and exile due to her marriage to Halberstam, who was expelled from Poland for his sharp criticisms of the regime at the time. Czyżewska's career was disrupted, and when she returned in 1968 at Wajda's invitation to play in his film, ''[[Everything for Sale]]'', production was complicated by the March outbreak of student protests and the start of that year's anti-Semitic expulsions. Ironically, Czyżewska herself was expelled, and partly because she promptly accepted a role in exiled director [[Aleksander Ford]]'s adaptation of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''The First Circle'', she was unable to work in Poland until 1980 with the rise of Poland's [[Solidarność]] (Solidarity) movement, led by [[Lech Wałęsa]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Career in the United States==
The 1987 [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Anna (1987 film)|Anna]]'' is loosely based on Czyżewska's life.  In the film, an exiled European movie star played by [[Sally Kirkland]], struggles to find work in New York City following her divorce from a well-connected intellectual, presumably based on David Halberstam. Kirkland was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in the Best Actress category for this role. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Czyżewska continued doing theater work in the U.S., winning an Obie Award in 1990 for her role in ''Crowbar'' by Mac Wellman. Her American premieres also include other Wellman plays as well as [[Janusz Glowacki]]'s ''Hunting Cockroaches''. She performed in Ibsen's ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' at the American Repertory Theater, and in several productions at [[Yale Repertory Theater]]. She also played in ''Big Potato'' (by [[Arthur Laurents]]) at the [[Doris Duke]] Theater. 

Her American films include ''[[Music Box (film)|Music Box]]'', ''[[Running on Empty (1988 film)|Running on Empty]]'', Eduardo Machado's ''Exiles In New York'' and ''Putney Swope''. Her television appearances include the American Playhouse drama ''Misplaced'' on [[PBS]]. Her most recent theater roles were in [[Martha Clarke]]'s ''Vienna Lusthaus'', [[Hedda Gabler]] at the New Theatre Workshop in 2004, and 'Darkling' in 2006. In June 2007, she returned to Poland for a performance of ''Darkling'' in [[Gniezno]] at the Aleksander Fredro Teatr.

In May 2005, Czyżewska was honored with the Cultural Award of Merit by the Consul General of the New York Polish Consulate. This is the highest award for a Polish American to receive. The ceremony began the first American retrospective of her work at the first New York Polish Film Festival, directed by Hanna Hartowicz. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Her final leading role was in the film June Weddings, adapted from a play written and directed by Barbara Hammond, that brought her great critical praise on the film festival circuit.   Her role of a Russian émigré in New York was called &quot;superbly acted&quot; and &quot;a grown-up feast&quot;.  &quot;The delightful Elzbieta Czyzewska plays a Russian woman so slyly, seductively Old World and languorous she gives &quot;v&quot; its own beat when she says &quot;love.&quot;    Baltimore's City Paper (Oct 23, 2008).   The film also starred Tom Noonan.

==Death==
She died on June 17, 2010 in New York at the age of 72 from [[esophageal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/18czyz.html?ref=obituaries ''New York Times'' obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;
John Guare wrote Erased/Elzbieta a tribute play to Elzbieta Czyzewska which premiered at Atlantic Theater in NY in 2011.

'''David Henry Hwang''' ({{zh|c=黃哲倫|p=Huáng Zhélún}}; born August 11, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], [[librettist]], and [[screenwriter]].

==Early Life==
He was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to Henry Yuan Hwang, a banker, and Dorothy Hwang, a piano teacher. Hwang was the oldest of three children. He has two younger sisters. He was educated at the [[Yale School of Drama]] and received a Bachelor's Degree in English from [[Stanford University]]. His first play was produced at the Okada House dormitory at Stanford after he briefly studied playwriting with [[Sam Shepard]] and [[María Irene Fornés]].

==Career==
[[File:DAVIDHENRYHWANG1979SF.jpg|thumb|left|Playwright David Henry Hwang teaching a writing
class in San Francisco's Fort Mason in 1979]]
=== Isolationalist-Nationalist Phase/Trilogy of Chinese America ===
Hwang's early plays concerned the role of the [[Chinese American]] and [[Asian American]] in the modern day world. His first play, the [[Obie Award]]-winning ''[[FOB (play)|FOB]]'', depicts the contrasts and conflicts between established Asian Americans and &quot;[[Fresh off the boat|Fresh Off the Boat]]&quot; newcomer immigrants. The play was developed by the National Playwrights Conference at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] and premiered in 1980 [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Joseph Papp Public Theater]]. Papp went on to produce four more of Hwang's plays, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated drama ''[[The Dance and the Railroad]]'', which tells the story of a former [[Chinese opera]] star working as a [[coolie]] laborer in the nineteenth century, and the Drama Desk Award-nominated ''[[Family Devotions]]'', a darkly comic take on the effects of Western religion on a Chinese family. Those three plays added up to a &quot;Trilogy of Chinese America&quot; as the author described.

=== Branching Out/National Success ===
After this, Papp also produced the show ''[[Sound and Beauty]]'', the omnibus title to two Hwang one-act plays set in [[Japan]]. At this time, Hwang started to work on projects for the small screen. A television movie, ''[[Blind Alleys]]'', written by Hwang and Frederic Kimball and starring [[Pat Morita]] and [[Cloris Leachman]], was produced.

His next play, ''[[Rich Relations]]'', was his first to feature non-Asian characters. It premiered at the [[Second Stage Theatre]] in New York and, though not a success, did prepare him for his work on his best-known play, ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', for which he won a [[Tony Award]], the [[Drama Desk Award]], the John Gassner Award, and the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Play. It was also his second play to be a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play is a deconstruction of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s opera ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. The play is also loosely based on news reports of the relationship between a French diplomat, [[Bernard Boursicot]], and [[Shi Pei Pu]], a male Chinese opera singer who purportedly convinced Boursicot that he was a woman throughout their twenty-year relationship. The play premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1988 and made Hwang the first Asian American to win the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].

=== Work Post-''Butterfly'' ===
The success of ''M. Butterfly'' prompted Hwang's interests in many other different directions, including work for [[opera]], [[film]], and the [[musical theatre]]. Hwang became a frequent collaborator as a librettist with the world-renowned composer [[Philip Glass]].

Additionally, one of ''M. Butterfly'''s Broadway producers, [[David Geffen]], spear-headed a [[M. Butterfly (film)|film version]] of the play, which was directed by [[David Cronenberg]]. Hwang also wrote an original script, ''[[Golden Gate (film)|Golden Gate]]'', which was produced by [[American Playhouse]]. Hwang wrote an early draft of a screenplay based upon [[A. S. Byatt]]'s [[Booker Prize]]-winning novel ''[[Possession: A Romance|Possession]]'', which was originally scheduled for director [[Sydney Pollack]]. Years later, director/playwright [[Neil LaBute]] and [[Laura Jones (screenwriter)|Laura Jones]] would collaborate on the script for a [[Possession (2002 film)|2002 film]].

Still, throughout the 1990s, Hwang continued to write for the stage, including short plays for the famed [[Humana Festival]] at the [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] and ''[[Golden Child (play)|Golden Child]]'', which received its world premiere at [[South Coast Repertory]] in 1996. ''[[Golden Child (play)|Golden Child]]'' later became his second Broadway venture and won the 1997 Obie Award for its Off-Broadway production and gave Hwang his second Tony nomination.

=== Return to Broadway with Disney and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein ===
In the new millennium, Hwang had two Broadway successes back-to-back. He was asked by director Robert Falls to help co-write the book for the musical ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' (based upon the opera by [[Giuseppe Verdi]]), which, in an earlier format, had failed in regional theatre tryouts. Hwang and Falls re-wrote a significant portion of the book (by [[Linda Woolverton]]) and ''Aida'' (with music and lyrics by [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]]) opened in 2000 to great box office business.

His next project was a radical revision of [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Oscar Hammerstein, II]], and [[Joseph Fields]]' musical ''[[Flower Drum Song]]''. Although successful when introduced in the 1950s and early 1960s, it had become dated after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] redefined the viability of stereotypical portrayals of Asian American communities. Though it had never been a full critical success relative to other Rodgers and Hammerstein productions such as ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and ''[[The King and I]]'', it inspired another generation of Asian Americans to re-imagine the musical. Adapted from the novel ''The Flower Drum Song'' by [[C. Y. Lee (author)|C. Y. Lee]], it tells the story of a culture clash with a Chinese family living in [[San Francisco]]. The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization allowed Hwang to significantly rework the plot, while retaining character names and songs. His version —both an homage to the original and a modern re-thinking— won him his third Tony nomination. Though ''Flower Drum Song'' is often called the first musical with an all-Asian cast, it was the 2002 revival of the play which was finally produced with an all-Asian cast of actor-singers. The original production had cast many non-Asians in leading roles, including Caucasians and an African-American ([[Juanita Hall]]). The revival went on to a national tour.

=== Back to the Public ===
Hwang's 2007 play ''[[Yellow Face]]'' centers on his one failed Broadway experiment ''[[Face Value (play)|Face Value]]'', which closed in previews on Broadway back in the early 1990s and was written in response to a controversy about the casting of [[Jonathan Pryce]] in a Eurasian role in ''[[Miss Saigon]]''. ''[[Face Value (play)|Face Value]]'', which also included music and lyrics for a musical-within-a-play by Hwang, lost millions of dollars and was a stumbling block in the careers of Hwang and producer [[Stuart Ostrow]].

Hwang decided to turn the experience into a semi-autobiographical play which pits him as the main character in a media farce about mistaken racial identity, which was also a major premise of ''[[Face Value (play)|Face Value]]''.

''[[Yellow Face]]'' premiered in Los Angeles in 2007 at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] as a co-production with [[East West Players]] and then moved Off-Broadway to the [[Joseph Papp Public Theater]], which was so important in Hwang's earlier work. There, it enjoyed an extended run, won Hwang his third Obie Award in Playwriting, and made him a third-time finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. Hwang also wrote a new short play, ''[[The great helmsman (play)|The Great Helmsman]]'' for their night of plays ''Ten''.

=== Recent Work ===
Hwang has continued to work steadily in the world of opera and musical theatre and has written for children's theatre as well. Hwang co-wrote the English language libretto for an operatic adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (opera)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' with music (and part of the libretto) by the Korean composer [[Unsuk Chin]], which received its world premiere at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in 2007 and was released on DVD in 2008. Hwang wrote the [[libretto]] to [[Howard Shore]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]'', based on [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1986 film [[The Fly (1986 film)|of the same name]]; the opera premiered on July 2, 2008 at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, France with Cronenberg as director and [[Plácido Domingo]] conducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-07-04
|year = 2008
|publisher = [[Los Angeles Opera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hwang was also represented on Broadway as the librettist for ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', a musical based on a film by Walt Disney Pictures.

Hwang also collaborated on the multi-media event ''[[Icarus at the edge of time (multi-media presentation)|Icarus at the Edge of Time]]'', adapted from [[Brian Greene]]'s [[Icarus at the Edge of Time|novel]]. It also featured music by [[Philip Glass]] and a film by &quot;Al and Al.&quot; The piece premiered as part of the [[World Science Festival]].

After its major success at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Hwang's newest play, the [[Joseph Jefferson Award]]-winning ''[[Chinglish (play)|Chinglish]]'', quickly made its way to Broadway in October 2011. ''Chinglish'' was largely inspired by his frequent visits to China and his observations of interactions between Chinese and American people. However, ticket sales of Chinglish remained conservative. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?david_henry_hwangs_chinglish_on_broadway_17583.aspx | title = David Henry Hwang's Chinglish on Broadway | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 10/25/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent short play, ''[[A Very DNA Reunion]]'' was written for the evening of plays ''The DNA Trail'', which was conceived by Jamil Khoury and premiered at the historic [[Chicago Temple Building]].

=== Upcoming ===
Hwang is at work on a new play called ''Kung Fu'' which will premiere as a result of Hwang's residency at the [[Signature Theatre Company (New York City)|Signature Theatre]] in addition to a theatrical commission for the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] and [[Arena Stage]], a musical version of [[Aimee Mann]]'s album ''[[The Forgotten Arm]]'' with Mann and Paul Bryant, and screenplays for [[Dreamworks Animation]] and directors [[Justin Lin]] and [[Jonathan Caouette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Godfrey MacArthur Cambridge''' (February 26, 1933 &amp;ndash; November 29, 1976) was an American [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. Alongside [[Bill Cosby]], [[Dick Gregory]], and [[Nipsey Russell]], he was acclaimed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1965 as &quot;one of the country's four most celebrated Negro comedians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time65&quot;/&gt;

==Early years==
Cambridge was born on February 26, 1933 in [[New York City]], to Sarah and Alexander Cambridge, who were immigrants from [[British Guiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aarentry&quot;/&gt;  His parents, dissatisfied by the [[New York Public School System]], sent him to live with his grandparents in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] during his [[primary school]] years.&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt; When he was 13, he moved back to New York and attended [[Flushing High School]] in [[Flushing, Queens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt;

In 1949 he received a four-year scholarship to study medicine at [[Hofstra College]],&lt;ref name=&quot;jet76&quot;/&gt; which he attended for three years before dropping out to pursue a career in acting.&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt;

==Stage and screen career==
While pursuing an acting career Cambridge supported himself with a variety of jobs, including &quot;cab driver, bead-sorter, ambulance driver, gardener, judo instructor, and clerk for the [[New York City Housing Authority]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt; as well as cleaning airplanes and making popcorn bunnies.&lt;ref name=&quot;jet76&quot;/&gt;

Cambridge's first role was as a bartender in the [[off-Broadway]] play ''[[Take a Giant Step]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jet76&quot;/&gt; He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the original production of [[Herman Wouk]]'s 1957 play ''[[Nature's Way (play)|Nature's Way]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdbbio&quot;/&gt; Cambridge received a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play#1960s|1962 Tony Award nomination]] as part of the original cast of ''[[Purlie Victorious]]'', a play written by and starring [[Ossie Davis]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdbbio&quot;/&gt; he was featured in an opening-night cast that also included [[Ruby Dee]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Sorrell Booke]], [[Roger C. Carmel]], [[Helen Martin]], and [[Beah Richards]].

Godfrey's memorable film roles include ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'', in which he plays the lead character, a white bigot who one day wakes up and discovers his skin color has turned black, and ''[[The President's Analyst]]'', where he plays a depressed government agent. He also had a starring role in the 1970 [[Ossie Davis]] adaptation of the [[Chester Himes]] novel ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'', as well as its 1972 sequel, ''[[Come Back, Charleston Blue]]''. Godfrey made an impressive cameo appearance in director [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Bye Bye Braverman]]'' as a [[Yiddish]] speaking NYC cab driver involved in a car collision with the main protagonists, and another as a [[gay]] [[Mobster|underworld figure]] in the 1975 [[Pam Grier]] vehicle ''[[Friday Foster]]''. Cambridge had a starring role in ''[[Beware! The Blob]]'', a sequel to ''[[The Blob]]''. 

He hosted{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}, financed,  and produced ''Dead is Dead'' (1970), a drug-awareness film. It gave an uncensored look at the downside of drug-use, showing actual drug users injecting drugs and going through [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New York Times

Cambridge appeared on several [[network television]] programs, including ''[[Car 54 Where Are You?]]'' (&quot;The Curse of the Snitkins&quot;), ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (&quot;The Man From My Uncle&quot;), ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' (&quot;Court of the Lion&quot;), and [[Police Story (TV series)|Police Story]] (&quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;). He also had a small speaking part as a member of Sgt. Bilko's platoon in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', 1957 episode &quot;Boys Town&quot;. Cambridge gave an acclaimed performance alongside [[Tom Bosley]] in the episode &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot; of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'', a story about a failed comedian who looks to a [[genie]] for a quick fix to success; the episode was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. He perhaps reached his largest television audience in a series of comical commercials for [[Jockey International|Jockey]] brand underwear.

He later appeared in [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks: A Clown Show]]'', giving a performance that earned him an [[Obie Award]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb name|Godfrey|Cambridge|M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later he did a stock version of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''.

==Stand-up comedy==
{{rquote|right|I am only concerned with letting people see the truth of our lives, like, for example, the way Negroes are afraid of each other too. We have got to show the common bonds. I have an act about people staring at a Negro in the Safeway. I want people to realize that they really do stare. We must bring things out into the open. There are some people you can't reach. You neutralize this kind. If two men are laughing at each other, nobody gets stabbed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time65&quot;/&gt;|Cambridge in February 1965, on his stand-up act.}}

In addition to acting, Cambridge had major success as a [[stand-up comedian]]. By 1965 he was earning &quot;as much as $4,000 a week...in all respects a headliner, working the best places, such as San Francisco's [[hungry i]] and Hollywood's [[Crescendo Club|Crescendo]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time65&quot;/&gt;  He appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. His routines were imbued with biting sarcasm and trenchant topical humor that was common in comedic circles at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was noted for comic lapses from standard educated speech to Black street-speak.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Personal life==
Cambridge, along with writer [[Maya Angelou]] and actor [[Hugh Hurd]], organized one of the first benefits for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] held in [[New York City]]; according to Angelou, it was held at [[the Village Gate]] in the late 1950s and raised $9,000 for King's civil rights movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt95&quot;/&gt; (On his 1964 album ''Ready Or Not'', Cambridge joked he was supporting [[Barry Goldwater]], saying that the GOP presidential nominee had &quot;come flat out against [[slavery]]...in principle!&quot;)

Cambridge married actress [[Barbara Ann Teer]] in 1962; the couple divorced three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;blapast&quot;/&gt; During the 1970s he remained in semi-retirement, making few public appearances&lt;ref name=&quot;aarentry&quot;/&gt; and marrying Audriano Meyers in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;jet75&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
Cambridge died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 43 while on the [[Burbank, California]], set of the ABC television movie ''[[Victory at Entebbe]]'', in which he was to portray [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jet76&quot;/&gt; Amin commented Cambridge's death was &quot;punishment from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''C. Bernard Jackson''' (November 4, 1927 – July 16, 1996)  was an award-winning American playwright who founded the Inner City Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Inner City was one of the first arts institutions in the United States to promote [[multiculturalism]].  The facility nurtured the careers of numerous performers including [[Beah Richards]], [[George Takei]], [[Edward James Olmos]], [[Nobu McCarthy]] and [[Forest Whitaker]].&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'&gt;{{cite news | author=Breslauer, Jan | title=A Trailblazer for Diversity | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-31/entertainment/ca-2329_1_cultural-center | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=1991-03-31 | accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Background===
Clarence Bernard Jackson grew up in the [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] section of [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], where he was involved in one of the city's toughest street gangs. Because he was able to speak Spanish, Jackson often served in a diplomatic capacity.&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'/&gt;

When he enrolled in the High School of Music and Art, Jackson was able to escape the negative influences of his neighborhood and obtain a broader view of the world.  He subsequently attended [[Brooklyn College]] and pursued a master's degree in music at UCLA.&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'/&gt;

===Career===
In 1959, he co-wrote (with James Hatch), the book and music for ''Fly Blackbird,'' a musical dealing with civil rights. The production featuring a multi-ethnic cast was very popular with Los Angeles audiences, if not with critics.  ''Fly Blackbird'' opened [[Off Broadway|off-Broadway]] in 1961 and received an [[Obie Award]] for Best Musical the following year.&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Infoplease-Obie'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153539.html |title=1961-1962 Obie Awards |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year=2007 |work= |publisher=Infoplease |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2010-12-10 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the wake of the [[Watts Riots]], he founded the Inner City Cultural Center in Central Los Angeles.  Unlike other arts organizations that catered to one ethnic group or another, Inner City was operated under the concept of [[multiculturalism]] and provided assistance to a wide variety of cultural institutions. This included [[Luis Valdez]]'s El Teatro Campesino, the East-West Players and the Bilingual Foundation for the Arts, founded by [[Carmen Zapata]].&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'/&gt; 

Inner City's multi-cultural approach did not come without criticism from the black artistic community and the mainstream press, despite the fact that Inner City was also the largest producer of black theatre in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name='BlackWorld-Apr1976'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayete |first=Cynthia Cotton |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1976 |month=April |title=Annual Roundup: Black Theater in America (Los Angeles section)|trans_title= |journal=Black World |volume=25 |series= |issue=6 |page= |pages=75–77 |at= |chapter= |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-link= |language= |format= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate= |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was also a proponent of [[colour-blind casting|non-traditional casting]].  For example, in 1975, Inner City produced ''Maggie The Mouse Meets The Dirty Rat Fink,'' a [[Christmas]] musical that was written by Jackson. In the production, a black man and woman were cast as the parents of a Japanese daughter and a Chicano son. The following year, Jackson staged, ''Langston Hughes Said'', a musical tribute to the Harlem Renaissance writer.  The production included Hughes's one-act play, ''Soul Gone Home'' and featured a Chinese mother with her son played simultaneously by two actors, one black and the other Chicano.&lt;ref name='BlackWorld-Apr1976'/&gt;

Throughout his thirty years as executive director of the Inner City Cultural Center, Jackson nurtured numerous artists at various stages in their careers.&lt;ref name='LAT-Trailbrazer'/&gt;&lt;ref name='LAT-Gift'&gt;{{cite news | author=Wolfe, George C. | title=Recalling C. Bernard Jackson's Gift | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-22/entertainment/ca-26736_1_bernard-jackson-city | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=1996-07-22 | accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on July 16, 1996.&lt;ref name='LAT-Future'&gt;{{cite news | author=Shirley, Don | title=Inner City Center Faces the Future | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-28/entertainment/ca-28715_1_training-center | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=1996-07-28 | accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his death, playwright [[George C. Wolfe]] recalled how Jackson encouraged him to stage one of his early projects, &quot;Tribal Rites, or The Coming of the Great God-bird Nabuku to the Age of Horace Lee Lizer.&quot; &quot;Though I've been involved in many projects since,&quot; Wolfe said, &quot;this production was perhaps the most crucial to my evolution&quot; as an artist.&lt;ref name='LAT-Gift'/&gt;

'''Frank Daniel Gilroy''' (born 13 October 1925) is an American [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]], and [[film producer]] and [[film director|director]]. He received the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his play ''[[The Subject Was Roses]]'' in 1965.

==Early life==
Gilroy was born on October 13, 1925, in [[New York City]], the son of Bettina (née Vasti) and Frank B. Gilroy, a coffee broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Frank D. Gilroy  Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/27/Frank-D-Gilroy.html | work=filmreference | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Irish American]] and his mother was of Italian and German descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colby|first=Vineta|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=World authors, 1985-1990|publisher=H.W. Wilson|year=1995|location=|pages=304|month=|url=|isbn=0824208757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilroy lived in [[the Bronx]] for most of his childhood and attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. He then enlisted in the army after graduation. He served two and a half years in the [[89th Division (United States)|89th Division]], of which eighteen months were in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]].

After the war, he attended [[Dartmouth College]] and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]. Later in 1966, he would receive an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.L.]]. He also received a grant from Dartmouth that allowed him to attend the [[Yale School of Drama]].

==Writing career==
Gilroy wrote in the [[Golden Age of Television]] for such shows as ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Westinghouse Studio One]]'', ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'', ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', and ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]''.

His entrance to theatre was marked with his 1962 play ''Who'll Save the Plowboy?'' at the Phoenix Theatre in New York, which won the [[Obie Award]]. The play follows Albert Cobb, a man who once dreamed of owning a farm, becoming a plowboy. He and his wife Helen are awaiting to be reunited fifteen years after World War II, along with Larry Doyle, the man who saved his life. The title comes from when they were in the war, and Albert was staked as bait by the Germans, and Larry kept shouting &quot;Who'll Save the Plowboy?&quot; until he finally crept out and saved him.

''[[The Subject Was Roses]]'' was presented on May 25, 1964.  The two-act play has been compared to [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Lawrence J. (1992). [http://books.google.com/books?id=log94sLM6gsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Textures of Irish America''], p. 63. Syracuse University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Kerr said of the show: &quot;a family triangle in which a father loves a son and the mother loves that son and the son loves both mother and father and not one of them can make a move or utter a sound that does not instantly damage the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coy|first=Stephen C.|title=Twentieth-Century American Dramatists|year=1981 |publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-8103-0928-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''That Summer, That Fall'' (1967) is a version of the [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]-[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] story. The play is set in an Italian neighborhood in [[Lower Manhattan]] in an apartment complex.

Gilroy's works include [[screenplay]]s for the films ''[[Desperate Characters]]'' (starring [[Shirley MacLaine]]) and ''[[The Gallant Hours]]'' (starring [[James Cagney]]). He has also adapted his own plays for film, including ''[[The Subject Was Roses (film)|The Subject Was Roses]]'' (starring [[Patricia Neal]], [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Jack Albertson]]) and ''[[The Only Game in Town (film)|The Only Game in Town]]'' (starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Warren Beatty]]).  His 1985 screenplay for ''The Gig'' (starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Wayne Rogers]]) has been adapted as a [[musical theatre|musical]], with book, music, and lyrics by [[Douglas J. Cohen]].  A 2006 [[Off-Broadway]] presentation and recording by the [[York Theatre Company]] starred [[Karen Ziemba]], Stephen Berger, [[Michele Pawk]], and Michael McCormick.&lt;ref name='BROADWAY WORLD'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Photo Coverage: The York Theatre Company's The Gig | date=2006-05-06 | publisher=BroadwayWorld.com | url =http://broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Coverage_The_York_Theatre_Companys_The_Gig_20060506 | work =BroadwayWorld.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilroy has also written fiction, including the novel ''From Noon Till Three'', which was adapted into [[From Noon Till Three|a film]] starring [[Charles Bronson]]. In addition to writing the screenplay, Gilroy also directed the film. Gilroy also contributed to several TV westerns in the late 1950s, including ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'' and ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]''. His later credits include ''[[Nero Wolfe (film)|Nero Wolfe]]'', a 1977 adaptation of [[Rex Stout]]'s novel ''[[The Doorbell Rang]]'' as a [[television]] movie featuring [[Thayer David]].

==Personal life==
Gilroy's three sons, from his marriage to sculptor/writer Ruth Dorothy Gaydos, are involved in the film industry. [[Tony Gilroy]] and [[Dan Gilroy]] are screenwriters, and John Gilroy is a film editor.

'''John Guare'''  (pronounced &quot;gwâr&quot;; born February 5, 1938) is an American [[playwright]].  He is best known as the author of ''[[The House of Blue Leaves]]'', ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', and ''[[Landscape of the Body]]''. His style, which mixes comic invention with an acute sense of the failure of human relations and aspirations, is at once cruel and deeply compassionate.

In the foreword to a collection of Guare's plays, film director [[Louis Malle]] writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Guare practices a humor that is synonymous with lucidity, exploding genre and clichés, taking us to the core of human suffering: the awareness of corruption in our own bodies, death circling in. We try to fight it all by creating various mythologies, and it is Guare's peculiar aptitude for exposing these grandiose lies of ours that makes his work so magical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Guare was born in New York City and raised in Jackson Heights, Queens. He was raised a [[Roman Catholic]], but is apparently now a [[lapsed Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adherents.com/people/pg/John_Guare.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Georgetown University]] (BA, 1960), where in 1958 he contributed a song to an original musical revue entitled ''The Natives Are Restless'' and presented by the [[Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society]].  The song humorously attributed the success of many famous people to the syllable &quot;O&quot; in their names. Under the direction of [[Donn B. Murphy]], his play ''The Toadstool Boy'', about a country singer's quest for fame, won first place in the [[District of Columbia]] Recreation Department's One-Act-Play competition.  

In 1960, the Mask and Bauble presented ''The Thirties Girl,'' a musical for which Guare did the book, much of the music and the lyrics, again under Murphy's tutelage. Set in Hollywood's turbulent 1920s, it dealt with the dethronement of a reigning diva by a fresh-faced starlet. Guare went on to the [[Yale School of Drama]] (MFA, 1963).

==Career==
Guare's early plays, mostly comic one-acts exhibiting a flair for the absurd, include ''To Wally Pantoni, We Leave a Credenza'' (1964), ''[[Muzeeka]]'' (1968), and ''[[Cop-Out (play)|Cop-Out]]'' (1968). ''[[The House of Blue Leaves]]'' (1971), a domestic drama by turns wildly comic and despairingly desperate, moved Guare into the front ranks of American dramatists. ''[[Chaucer in Rome]]'', a sequel to  ''The House of Blue Leaves,'' received its world premiere at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in July 1999 and later enjoyed a production in New York by [[Lincoln Center Theater]].

Later plays include ''[[Marco Polo Sings a Solo]]'', ''[[Bosoms and Neglect]]'', ''[[Moon Over Miami (play)|Moon Over Miami]]'', ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', and ''[[Four Baboons Adoring the Sun]]''. ''[[Lake Hollywood (play)|Lake Hollywood]]'' and ''[[A Few Stout Individuals]]'' (2002) both received their world premieres at Signature Theatre. ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1990), an intricately plotted comedy of manners about an African-American [[confidence trick|confidence man]] who poses as the son of film star [[Sidney Poitier]], has been the most highly praised and widely produced of Guare's full-length plays. It was made into a film in 1993.

Guare’s cycle of plays on nineteenth-century America, ''[[Gardenia]]'', ''[[Lydie Breeze]]'' and ''[[Women and Water]]'', has been performed in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington D.C., London and Australia. ''[[A Few Stout Individuals]]'' returns to nineteenth century America, with a cast that includes [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Mark Twain]], soprano [[Adelina Patti]] and the Emperor and Empress of Japan. These historic dramas investigate the violence at the root of American identity and the failure of [[utopia]]n aspirations.

Guare has also been involved with musical theatre. His libretto with [[Mel Shapiro]] for the musical ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' was a success when it premiered in 1971 and was revived in 2005 at the [[Public Theater]]'s [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. It won the two men the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical]]. He wrote the songs for ''[[Landscape of the Body]].'' Guare wrote narration for '&quot;Psyche,&quot;' a tone poem by [[César Franck]], which premiered at [[Avery Fisher Hall]] in October 1997, conducted by [[Kurt Masur]] with the [[New York Philharmonic]]. In 1999, he revised the book of the [[Cole Porter]] musical comedy, ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' for its Broadway revival. He also wrote the book for the Broadway musical ''[[Sweet Smell of Success (musical)]]''.

Guare wrote the screenplay for [[Louis Malle]]'s film ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1980),  for which he was nominated for an Oscar.

He was a founding member in 1965 of the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]], [[Connecticut]] and Resident Playwright at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] in 1976. He is a council member of the [[Dramatists Guild]], co-editor of the ''Lincoln Center Theater Review,'' co-produces the New Plays Reading Room Series at the [[Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts]] and teaches in the Playwriting department at the [[Yale School of Drama]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10229">'''Ain Gordon''' is an American [[playwright]], director and actor based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/people/?personid=17736 &quot;Ain Gordon Theatre Credits&quot;] on ''BroadwayWorld.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwcenter.org/lab.php?uid=1663&amp;s=1 &quot;Ain Gordon: Biography&quot;] on the Playwrights' Center (Minneapolis) website&lt;/ref&gt;  His work frequently deals with the interstices of history, focusing on people and events which are often overlooked or marginalized in &quot;official&quot; histories.  His style combines elements of traditional playwrighting with aspects of [[performance art]].

==Career==
Gordon began writing and directing for the stage in 1985, emerging in the downtown [[dance]]/performance scene with four consecutive seasons at [[Dance Theater Workshop]] (DTW) plus performances at Movement Research, [[The Poetry Project]], and [[Performance Space 122]].  By 1990 Gordon was recognized in the inaugural round of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] &quot;New Forms&quot; initiative – funding for artists whose work defied clear classification. He then began touring to venues including the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] , and [[Dance Place]] in Washington, DC. 

In 1991, Gordon entered a multi-project relationship with [[Soho Rep]] in New York City that encompassed five productions and workshops.  In 1992, he began a collaboration with his father, choreographer and director [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]], on ''The Family Business'', which went on to be performed in New York at [[Lincoln Center]]'s ''Serious Fun!'' Festival, Dance Theater Workshop, [[New York Theater Workshop]] and the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Jan. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/20460718.html?dids=20460718:20460718&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+04%2C+1995&amp;author=By+Jan+Stuart.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=A+Memorable+Portrayal+Of+a+Family+in+Turmoil&amp;pqatl=google &quot;A Memorable Portrayal Of a Family in Turmoil&quot;] ''[[Newsday]]'' (April 4, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  This production won him his first [[Obie Award]], in 1994.

In 1992, Gordon became Co-Director of the [[Pick Up Performance Company]], which had been founded by his father in 1971 and incorporated in 1978. 

Gordon won his second Obie Award in 1996 for his play ''Wally's Ghost'', which was presented at Soho Rep. In 1998, he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in Playwriting.  It was here that he gained recognition for his abiding subject: marginalized and forgotten history, and the invisible players who inhabit that space, developing a blend of historical fact, imagined truth and complete fiction that continues to dominate his work. 

Gordon's next few years were spent collaborating with David Gordon on two projects &amp;ndash; ''Punch and Judy Get Divorced'' for [[American Music Theater Festival]] and [[American Repertory Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/node/114 &quot;Punch and Judy Get Divorced&quot;] on the [[American Repertory Theater]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The First Picture Show'' for the [[American Conservatory Theater]] in San Francisco and the Mark Taper Forum in L.A. In addition, Gordon received a commission from the Taper, and another from the [[Lincoln Center Institute]], and had a new play workshopped at [[The Public Theater]] and Soho Rep. In 2001, Gordon returned to his roots in the Manhattan downtown scene with several productions at [[HERE Arts Center]], DTW, and [[P.S. 122]], including ''Art Life &amp; Show-Biz'', a &quot;non-fiction play&quot; which featured Lola Pashalinksi, [[Helen Gallagher]] and Gordon's mother, [[Valda Setterfield]].  The play was published in 2010 by [[Palgrave Macmillan]] in the anthology ''Dramaturgy of the Real''.  

Gordon continues to write theater that straddles the traditions of playwriting and performance art, blending fact and fiction.  Since 2005, his work has been awarded both the Multi-Arts Production Fund (MAP) Grant and the Arts Presenters Ensemble Theatre Collaborations Program grant funded by the [[Doris Duke|Doris Duke Charitable Trust]], with productions at the [[Krannert Center]] in [[Urbana, Illinois]], the VSA North Fourth Arts Center in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], 651 ARTS in [[Brooklyn]], LexArts in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and DiverseWorks in [[Houston, Texas]].  

In 2007, Gordon won his third Obie Award for his performance in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''Spalding Gray: Stories Left To Tell'', which also toured to venues including [[UCLA|UCLA Live]], the TBA Festival at the [[Portland Institute for Contemporary Art]] in Oregon, ICA Boston &amp;ndash; where he was an [[Elliot Norton Award]] nominee &amp;ndash; the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, and [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Philadelphia, among other venues.  In 2008-9 Gordon collaborated with choreographer [[Bebe Miller]] on ''Necessary Beauty'', a multi-disciplinary evening-length work co-commissioned by the [[Wexner Center]] of [[Ohio State University]], DTW, and the Myrna Loy Center/Helena Presents in [[Helena, Montana]]. He was commissioned by the VSA North Fourth Arts Center to write ''The History of Asking the Wrong Quesion'', rooted in Native American history, and developed a new two-person play, and one woman play, as a Core Writer of the Playwrights' Center in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Dancehunter.

The Painted Bride Art Center in [[Philadelphia]] commissioned Gordon to write ''If She Stood'', about the women of the early [[abolitionist]] movement in that city, including [[Sarah Grimké]] and [[Sarah Mapps Douglass]].  The play premiered on April 26, 2013.  Later in 2013, his new play, ''Not What Happened'', about [[historical reenactment]] and its relation to actual events, will be presented at a number of theatres, including the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts in [[Burlington, Vermont]], the Krannert Center, and at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

'''Rachel Rosenthal''' (born November 9, 1926 in [[Paris]], France) is an interdisciplinary artist, a teacher, and [[animal rights]] activist based in Los Angeles, California. She is also known for her smoothly shaven head. She is best known for her full-length performance art pieces which she has toured, with The Rachel Rosenthal Company, to numerous venues both within the United States and abroad. Theatres and festivals she has visited include: the Dance Theatre Workshop and Serious Fun! at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York City, the [[Kaaitheater]] in [[Brussels]], The Internationals Summer Theater Festival in [[Hamburg]], [[The Performance Space]] in [[Sydney]] and the Festival de Théâtre des Amériques [http://www.fta.qc.ca/87/16_rachel.html RACHEL'S BRAIN] (Théâtre Centaur, Montréal).

==Early life==
Rosenthal was born on November 9, 1926 in [[Paris]], France, into an assimilated [[Russia]]n Jewish family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;&gt;''Chronology'', established by Moira Roth with Elise griffin, Lorraine Lupo and Annika Marie, in ''Rachel Rosenthal'', ed. Moira Roth, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997, pp. 205-211&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Léonard Rosenthal, was a well-known merchant of Oriental pearls and precious stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearl&quot;&gt;ROSENTHAL, Leonard. ''The Kingdom of the Pearl'', Brentano's: New York, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jardin&quot;&gt;ROSENTHAL, Léonard. ''Au Jardin des Gemmes'', L'Édition d'Art H. Piazza: Paris, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Mara Jacoubovitch Rosenthal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;/&gt; During [[World War II]], her family escaped France, moving to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, via a short stay in Portugal. This périple inspired the creation of her piece, ''My Brazil''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;/&gt; In April 1941, her family left Brazil to settle in New York, where Rachel Rosenthal would later graduate from the [[The High School of Music and Art|High School of Music and Art]] and become a U.S. citizen. At the end of the war, Rosenthal undertook theater, art, and dance studies with [[Hans Hoffmann]], [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Jean-Louis Barrault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;/&gt; 

In 1955, she moved to California, where she created the experimental [[Instant Theatre]], performing in and directing it for ten years. The Cast Theatre, now named [[El Centro Theatre]] was where Instant Theatre was created. She was a leading figure in the L.A. Women's Art Movement in the 1970s and co-founded [[Womanspace]]. Rosenthal began teaching classes in performance in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;/&gt;

==Recent years==
Rosenthal formed The Rachel Rosenthal Company in 1989 in Los Angeles, California. The company's repertoire deals with themes such as environmental destruction, social justice issues, [[animal rights]], earth-based spirituality, in a hybrid form that combines voice, text, movement, music, video projection, and elaborate theatrical costuming, set design, and dramatic lighting, ultimately challenging the rigid boundaries that have traditionally separated performance art from theater. 

In 1990, Rosenthal premiered ''Pangaean Dreams'' at The Santa Monica Museum Of Art for The L.A. Festival.  In 1992 [[filename: FUTURFAX]] was commissioned by the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York. In 1994 she premiered her 56-performer piece [[Zone (performance art)|Zone]] at the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts Wadsworth Theatre.  Between 1994 and 1997, with her newly formed Company, she revived her acclaimed Instant Theatre of the 1950s and 1960s as TOHUBOHU! and went on to collaboratively create [[DBDBDB-d: An Evening]] (1994), TOHUBOHU! (1995–97), Meditation on the Life and Death of Ken Saro-Wiwa and [[Timepiece]] (1996), [[The Swans]] and [[The Unexpurgated Virgin]] (1997).  Both [[Timepiece]] and The Unexpurgated Virgin premiered at the [[Fall Ahead Festival]] at Cal State LA. In 2000, at FADO-Paul Couillard (born 1961) is a Canadian performance artist and new media artist, writer and curator and Toronto-based performance art producer,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.performanceart.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with 7a*11d (International Performance Art Festival), presented Rosenthal's final full-length performance piece, UR-BOOR, for two nights only. At the age of 73, Rosenthal said she was retiring from performance to dedicate herself to her animal rights activism and pursue a career as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.performanceart.ca/residence/rosenthal/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenthal has lectured at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]]'s Robert Lepper Distinguished Lecture in Creative Inquiry series, as a lecturer/presenter at the first Performance, Culture and Pedagogy Conference at Penn. State (1996).  Rosenthal has also been a visiting artist at  [[The Art Institute of Chicago]], [[New York University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], [[UC Irvine]],  [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[California Institute of the Arts]], and at the [[Naropa]], [[Esalen]] and [[Omega Institute]]s.

Artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] has honored her in a new suite of prints entitled ''Tribute 21''. Recipients include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[Dalai Lama]]. 

Rosenthal had a small part in an episode of [[Frasier]], specifically [[The Crucible (Frasier)|The Crucible]] in Season 1. As eccentric Seattle-based artist Martha Paxton, she attends a cocktail party in Frasier's residence as guest-of-honour, being the supposed artist of a painting Frasier is very proud of, only for her to tell him in front of all present the painting wasn't her work.

'''Ntozake Shange''' (phonetically ''n-to-zaki shan-gay'';&lt;ref name=Filmref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/63/Ntozoke-Shange.html Ntozake Shange Biography (1948-), Film Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; born October 18, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], and [[poet]].&lt;ref&gt;Lester,N: &quot;At the Heart of Shange's Feminism: An Interview&quot;, Black American Literature Forum, 24(4): 717-730&lt;/ref&gt; As a self-proclaimed [[Black feminism|black feminist]], she addresses issues relating to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[feminism]] in much of her work.

Shange is best known for the [[Obie Award]]-winning [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]''.

She also wrote ''[[Betsey Brown]]'', a novel about an [[African-American]] girl who runs away from home. Among her honors and awards are fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[Lila Wallace|Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund]], and a [[Pushcart Prize]]. Shange lives in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Felicia R. Lee, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/books/18shange.html &quot;A Writer’s Struggles, on and Off the Page,&quot;] ''New York Times'', September 17, 2010. Retrieved September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shange was born '''Paulette L. Williams'''&lt;ref name=Filmref /&gt; in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rutgers1&quot;&gt;http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/~cybers/shange2.html&lt;/ref&gt; to an upper-middle-class family. Her father, Paul T. Williams, was an [[Air Force]] surgeon, and her mother, Eloise Williams, was an educator and a psychiatric social worker. When she was aged 8, Shange's family moved to the racially segregated city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. As a result of the [[Brown v. Board of Education]] court decision, Shange was bussed to a white school where she endured [[racism]] and racist attacks.

Shange's family had a strong interest in the arts and encouraged her artistic education. Among the guests at their home were [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].

When Shange was 13, she returned to [[New Jersey]], where she graduated fron [[Trenton Central High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Ultimate New Jersey High School Year Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Shange enrolled at [[Barnard College]]. She graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' in [[American Studies]], then earned a master's degree in the same field from the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]]. However, Shange's college years were not all pleasant. She married during her first year in college, but the marriage did not last long. Depressed over her separation and with a strong sense of bitterness and alienation, she attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvonbooks.com/2010/10/15/interview-author-ntozake-shange-for-colored-girls/ Lynette Holloway, &quot;Interview With An Author: Ntozake Shange Returns to the Spotlight With Epic Novel and Film Adaptation of Groundbreaking 'For Colored Girls'&quot;, BV on Books, October 15 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, having come to terms with her depression and alienation, Shange changed her name. In [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], ''Ntozake'' means &quot;she who has her own things&quot; (literally &quot;things that belong to her&quot;) and ''Shange'' means &quot;he/she who walks/lives with lions&quot; (meaning &quot;the lion's pride&quot; in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;rutgers1&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
In 1975, Shange moved to [[New York City]], where in that year her first and most well-known play was produced — ''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf''. First produced [[Off-Broadway]], the play soon moved on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the Booth Theater and won several awards, including the [[Obie Award]], [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], and the [[AUDELCO]] Award. This play, her most famous work, was a 20-part poem that chronicled the lives of Black women in the United States. The poem was eventually made into the stage play, was then published in book form in [[1977 in literature|1977]], then made into a movie in 2010 (''[[For Colored Girls]]'', directed by [[Tyler Perry]]). Since then, Shange has written other successful plays, including an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' (1980), which won an Obie Award.

In 2003, Shange wrote and oversaw the production of ''Lavender Lizards and Lilac Landmines: Layla's Dream'' while serving as a visiting artist at the [[University of Florida, Gainesville]].

Her individual poems, essays, and short stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, including ''The Black Scholar'', ''Yardbird'', ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', ''[[Essence Magazine]]'', ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[VIBE]]'', and ''Third-World Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, H: An Interview with Ntozake Shange,&quot; Black American Literature Forum, 13(4): 134-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood===
James Earl Jones was born in [[Arkabutla, Mississippi]], son of [[Robert Earl Jones]] (1910–2006), an actor, boxer, butler, and chauffeur who left the family shortly after James Earl's birth, and his wife Ruth (Connolly) Jones, a teacher and maid.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title=James Earl Jones Biography (1931–) | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/4/James-Earl-Jones.html | work=Film Reference | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nwatrav&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Bandler| first=Michael J. | title=This is James Earl Jones | journal=NWA World Traveler | publisher=Northwest Airlines | url= http://www.nwaworldtraveler.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=3BA4583DD6074B17AC433C6F1DB1729B&amp;nm=Archives&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=EFE8668FC21A45458BA591255BB3367E | month=March | year=2008 | accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and his father reconciled many years later. Jones was raised by his maternal grandparents, farmers John Henry and Maggie Connolly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indianheritage&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title=James Earl Jones – Academy of Achievement | url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/photocredit/achievers/jon2-010 | work=A Museum of Living History |publisher=Academy of Achievement| accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is multiracial, with [[African]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Levesque | first=Carl | title=Unconventional wisdom: James Earl Jones speaks out | journal=Association Management | publisher=The Gale Group | url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-1928105_ITM | date=August 1, 2002 | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Dorothy Davis | title=Speaking with James Earl Jones | url=http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2005/february/html/Black-Jones.html | work=Education Update | date=February 2005 | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones describes his grandmother, Maggie, as &quot;the most racist person I have ever known&quot;, thus forcing him to develop his own independent thinking. His grandmother was of [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and black ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9655708.stm &quot;James Earl Jones on his 'racist grandmother'&quot;], interview with [[Stephen Sackur]], BBC News, December 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to his grandparents' farm in [[Jackson, Michigan]], when he was five, but the transition was traumatic and he developed a [[stutter]] so severe he refused to speak. When he moved to [[Brethren, Michigan]], in later years, a teacher at the Brethren schools helped him overcome his stutter. He remained functionally [[Selective mutism|mute]] for eight years, until he entered high school. He credits his English teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him end his silence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwatrav&quot;/&gt; Crouch believed forced [[public speaking]] would help Jones gain confidence and insisted he recite a poem in class every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage-visual-arts/the-daddy-of-them-all-1.1007614|title=The daddy of them all|publisher=heraldscotland.com|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I was a stutterer. I couldn't talk. So my first year of school was my first mute year, and then those mute years continued until I got to high school.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon2int-2 (Audio/Transcript). Interview with the [[American Academy of Achievement]] for the National Medal of Arts. June 29, 1996. Sun Valley, Idaho.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
After being educated at the Browning School for boys in his high school years and graduating from Brethren High School in Brethren, Michigan, Jones attended the [[University of Michigan]] where he was a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] [[Academic major|major]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nwatrav&quot;/&gt; He joined the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]], and excelled. He felt comfortable within the structure of the military environment, and enjoyed the camaraderie of his fellow cadets in the [[Pershing Rifles]] Drill Team and [[Scabbard and Blade]] Honor Society.&lt;ref&gt;Ensian (Yearbook of the University of Michigan), p. 156 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the [[Korean War]]. After four years of college, Jones graduated from the university in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vpcomm.umich.edu/aboutum/home/famousalumni.php |title=Notable Alumni |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
With the war intensifying in Korea, Jones expected to be sent to the war as soon as he received his commission as a second lieutenant. As he waited for his orders, he worked as a part-time stage crew hand at the [[Ramsdell Theatre]] in [[Manistee, Michigan]], where he had earlier performed. Jones was commissioned in mid 1953 and reported to [[Fort Benning]] to attend Infantry Officers Basic Course. He then attended [[Ranger School]] and received his [[Ranger Tab]] (although he stated during an interview on the BBC's ''[[The One Show]]'', screened on November 11, 2009, that he &quot;washed out&quot; of Ranger training). He was initially to report to [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], but his unit was instead sent to establish a cold weather training command at the [[Camp Hale]] near [[Leadville, Colorado]]. His battalion became a training unit in the rugged terrain of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Jones was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] prior to his discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Soldiers to Celebrities: James Earl Jones – U.S. Army|url=http://www.hiredguns.biz/profiles/jamesearljones.htm|work=Hollywood Hired Guns|publisher=Hired Guns Productions|date=January 20, 2008|accessdate=February 20, 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081227164746/http://www.hiredguns.biz/profiles/jamesearljones.htm | archivedate= December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to New York, where he studied at the American Theatre Wing, working as a janitor to support himself.

Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by [[David Prowse]] in the original trilogy, with Jones [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] Vader's dialogue in [[postproduction]] due to Prowse's strong [[West Country dialects|West Country accent]] being unsuitable for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Stop Look Listen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4690148.stm |title=The Green force |publisher=BBC News |date=February 14, 2006 |accessdate=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his own request, Jones was originally uncredited for the release of the first two films (he would later be credited for the two in the 1997 re-release):

{{quote|When [[Linda Blair]] did the girl in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', they hired [[Mercedes McCambridge]] to do the voice of the [[devil]] coming out of her. And there was controversy as to whether Mercedes should get credit. I was one who thought no, she was just [[special effects]]. So when it came to Darth Vader, I said, no I'm just special effects. But it became so identified that by the third one, I thought, OK I've been denying it, I've been saying it sounds like the [[7 Up|uncola]] nut guy Holder. [[Geoffrey Holder]]! ... But for the third one, I said OK, I'll let them put my name on it.&lt;ref name=newsday&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/fast-chat-james-earl-jones-1.883740 | title= Fast Chat: James Earl Jones |work=[[Newsday]] |location=[[New York]] |date=March 12, 2008 | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first= Frank | last= Lovece| accessdate=March 1, 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/69UOnwfCN | archivedate = July 28, 2012 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jones's dialogue as Vader was even changed in 1997 re-release of ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' involving a scene involving his character about to leave the ground level of Cloud City after [[Luke Skywalker]] fell down a shaft in his refusal to join the Sith Lord.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He would dub Vader's voice again for a different dialog with [[Emperor Palpatine]], now played by [[Ian McDiarmid]], for the 2004 DVD version.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Although uncredited, Jones's voice is possibly heard as Darth Vader at the conclusion of ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. When specifically asked whether he had supplied the voice, possibly from a previous recording, Jones told ''[[New York Newsday]]'': &quot;You'd have to ask [[George Lucas|Lucas]] about that. I don't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;

Jones reprised his role as the voice of Vader several times: he is credited in the movie ''[[Robots (film)|Robots]]'' with the voice of Darth Vader from a voice module.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Playing the king of Zamunda in the comedy ''[[Coming to America]]'', he echoed four Darth Vader phrases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} He also vocally appeared as Vader in the comedy film ''[[The Benchwarmers]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and the video games ''Star Wars: Monopoly'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Jones returned as Vader for the video game: ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and also reprised his role as Vader in the Disney attraction; ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Archival recordings of Jones's voice are also used for the [[Jedi Training Academy]] attraction at [[Disneyland]] and at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Other voiceover work===
His other voice roles include [[Mufasa]] in the 1994 animated [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[The Lion King]]'' and its direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''. Archive recordings from the film would later be used for the English version of the 2005 video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', since Jones himself did not reprise the role. He also voiced the Emperor of the Night in ''[[Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night]]''.

In 1990, Jones performed voice work for the Simpsons Halloween episode &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror]]&quot;, in which he was the narrator for the Simpsons' version of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot;. In 1992, Jones was often seen as the host on the video tele-monitor for the Sea World resort in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In 1996, he recited the classic baseball poem [[Casey at the Bat]], with the accompaniment of arranger/composer [[Steven Reineke]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

He also has done the [[CNN]] tagline, &quot;This is CNN&quot;, as well as &quot;This is CNN International&quot;, and the [[Bell Atlantic]] tagline, &quot;Bell Atlantic: The heart of communication&quot;. When Bell Atlantic became [[Verizon]], Jones used the tagline greeting of &quot;Welcome to Verizon&quot; or &quot;Verizon 411&quot; right before a phone call would go through. The opening for [[NBC]]'s coverage of the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics; &quot;the Big PI in the Sky&quot; (God) in the computer game
''[[Under a Killing Moon]]''; a [[Claymation]] film about [[Creation according to Genesis|The Creation]]; and several other guest spots on ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

===Television roles===
Jones has the unusual distinction of being the only actor to win two [[Emmys]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/james-earl-jones James Earl Jones Emmy Nominated]&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year, in 1991 as Best Actor for his role in ''[[Gabriel's Fire]]'' and as Best Supporting Actor for his work in ''[[Heat Wave (1990 film)|Heat Wave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/james-earl-jones-36131/bio |title=James Earl Jones Biography |author=Rebecca Flint Marx |publisher=All Movie Guide |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones portrayed the older version of author [[Alex Haley]], in the television mini-series ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;nwatrav&quot;/&gt; the [[Global Defence Initiative|GDI]]'s commanding general [[General Solomon|James Solomon]] in the live-action sequences of the video game ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]''; and widowed police officer Neb Langston in the television program ''[[Under One Roof (1995 American television series)|Under One Roof]]'', for which he received an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination. He also appeared in television and radio advertising for Verizon Business [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]] and Verizon Online DSL from [[Verizon Communications]].

Jones appeared in the 1963–64 television season in an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s drama series about college life, ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', starring [[Jason Evers]] and [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]]. He appeared on the soap opera ''[[Guiding Light]]''. He portrayed Thad Green on ''[[Mathnet]]'', a parody of ''[[Dragnet (TV series)|Dragnet]]''.

In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for a proposed children's television series called ''[[Sesame Street]]''; these shorts, combined with animated segments, were shown to groups of children to gauge the effectiveness of the then-groundbreaking ''Sesame Street'' format. As cited by production notes included in the DVD release ''[[Sesame Street: Old School|Sesame Street: Old School 1969–1974]]'', the short that had the greatest impact with test audiences was one showing bald-headed Jones counting slowly to ten. This and other segments featuring Jones were eventually aired as part of the ''Sesame Street'' series itself when it debuted later in 1969 and Jones is often cited as the first celebrity guest on that series, although a segment with [[Carol Burnett]] was the first to actually be broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwatrav&quot;/&gt;

He has played lead characters on television in three series. First, he appeared on the short-lived CBS police drama ''[[Paris (1979 TV series)|Paris]],'' which aired during autumn 1979. That show was notable as the first program on which [[Steven Bochco]] served as executive producer. The second show aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1990 and 1992, the first season being titled ''[[Gabriel's Fire]]'' and the second (after a format revision), ''Pros and Cons''.

In both formats of that show, Jones played a former policeman wrongly convicted of murder who, upon his release from prison, became a private eye. In 1995, Jones starred in ''[[Under One Roof (1995 TV series)|Under One Roof]]'' as Neb Langston, a widowed African-American police officer sharing his home in Seattle with his daughter, his married son with his children, and Neb's newly adopted son. The show was a mid-season replacement and lasted only six weeks.

From 1989 to 1993, Jones served as the host of the children's TV series ''[[Long Ago and Far Away (TV series)|Long Ago and Far Away]]''.

In 1996, James guest starred in the [[CBS]] drama ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'' as the Angels of Angels in the episode &quot;[[List of Touched by an Angel episodes (season 3)|Clipped Wings]]&quot;. In 1998, Jones starred in the widely acclaimed syndicated program ''[[An American Moment]]'' (created by [[James R. Kirk]] and Ninth Wave Productions). Jones took over the role left by Charles Kuralt, upon Kuralt's death. He also made a cameo appearance in a penultimate episodes of ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and has guest-starred on such sitcoms as [[NBC]]'s ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', CBS's ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', and [[the WB]] drama ''[[Everwood]]''. Jones also lent his voice for a narrative part in the [[Adam Sandler]] comedy, ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', released in June 2006. His voice is also used to create an audio version of the [[King James Bible|King James New Testament]].

==Personal life==
Jones has been married to actress [[Cecilia Hart]] since 1982. They have one child, Flynn Earl Jones. He was previously married to American actress/singer Julienne Marie (born March 21, 1937, [[Toledo, Ohio]]); they had no children.

==Early life==
John Leguizamo was born in [[Bogotá]], Colombia, to Alberto and Luz Leguizamo. According to Leguizamo, his paternal grandfather was of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] and [[Italy|Italian]] descent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leguizamo| first = John| title = Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas, And All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Ecco]]| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 8| isbn = 0-06-052071-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his maternal grandfather was [[Lebanon|Lebanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Leguizamo has also described himself as being of [[Amerindian]] and [[Mestizo]] heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E1DB1F3AF93BA35751C0A96E958260&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=THEATER; In Town, on the Edge: Listening In on Solo Acts|date=1998-02-08|author=Leguizamo, John|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leguizamo's father was once an aspiring film director and studied at [[Cinecittà]], but eventually dropped out due to lack of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When Leguizamo was four years old, his family emigrated to the United States&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in various neighborhoods of [[Queens, New York|Queens]] in New York City, including [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;&gt;Zook, Kristal Brent.

Accessed June 11, 2009. &quot;Born in Bogota, Colombia, to a Puerto Rican father and a Colombian mother of Indian ancestry, [John Leguizamo] was raised in the multiethnic Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

He later credited growing up as one of the first Latino children in his Jackson Heights neighborhood as formative in his acting ability: &quot;It was tough. There were lots of fights. I would walk through a park and be attacked, and I had to defend myself all the time. But this helped me to become funny so that I wouldn’t get hit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=Hay Festival Cartagena: John Leguizamo on Hollywood|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9043565/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-John-Leguizamo-on-Hollywood.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=January 31, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leguizamo attended the [[Joseph Pulitzer Middle School]] (I.S.145) and later the [[Murry Bergtraum High School]]. As a student at Murry Bergtraum, Leguizamo wrote comedy material and tested it out on his classmates. He was voted &quot;Most Talkative&quot; by his classmates. After graduating from high school, he began his theater career as an undergraduate at NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]] from which he eventually dropped out in favor of a career in stand-up comedy. Post NYU Leguizamo enrolled at [[Long Island University C.W. Post Campus]] where he took theater classes.

==Career==

===Early career===
Leguizamo started out as a stand-up comic doing the New York nightclub circuit. In 1984, he made his television debut with a small part in ''[[Miami Vice]]''. His other early roles include: an extra in Madonna's ''[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]'' video (1984) playing a friend of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s boyfriend; ''Mixed Blood'' (1985); ''[[Casualties of War (film)|Casualties of War]]'' (1989); a terrorist in ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990); ''[[Hangin' with the Homeboys]]'' (1991); the robber in ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991) and ''[[Night Owl (film)|Night Owl]]'' (a.k.a. ''Nite Owl'') (1993), which was filmed from 1989–1991.

===Film===
[[File:John Leguizamo 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Leguizamo at the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].]]

In 1992, he starred in &quot;Whispers in the Dark&quot; as John Castillo. In 1993 Leguizamo was offered the lead part as [[Luigi]] in the film ''[[Super Mario Bros (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on the [[Mario]] video game franchise. Despite being considered a critical and financial failure universally, the film started his acting career in Hollywood and became one of his memorable roles. It also provided a boost to his career, allowing him to appear in better comedic roles in the following years, which helped the film reached its cult film status among his fans. That same year, he had a prominent role in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' as Carlito Brigante's ([[Al Pacino]]) nemesis, &quot;Benny Blanco from the Bronx,&quot; which also boosted his career in serious roles.

Leguizamo also starred in ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' as [[Tybalt]] Capulet, as [[Violator (comics)|Violator]] in ''[[Spawn (film)|Spawn]]'', Cholo in ''[[Land of the Dead]]'' and Pestario 'Pest' Vargas in ''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]''. In 1995, he starred as drag queen Chi-Chi Rodriguez in ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]'' and in the 1996 action film ''[[Executive Decision]]'' as Captain Rat. In 2002, he starred in the movie ''[[Empire (2002 film)|Empire]]''.

In 2000, Leguizamo played two genies in the [[Emmy Award]] winning miniseries ''[[Arabian Nights (miniseries)|Arabian Nights]]''.

To promote the 2001 movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', he appeared on a celebrity edition of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' with [[Kelly Ripa]], [[Kevin Sorbo]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Martin Short]] and [[Chevy Chase]]. Appearing as the first celebrity to sit in the hot seat, he eventually tried for $125,000, but got the answer wrong. Later in 2002, on the syndicated version, a question about the movie featured his character and [[Meredith Vieira]] mentioned that Leguizamo had played Lautrec and had been on the show.

In 2002 he voiced [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid the Sloth]] for the film ''[[Ice Age (film)|Ice Age]]'', reprising the role for the sequels ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown|Ice Age 2: The Meltdown]]'', ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs|Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift|Ice Age 4: Continental Drift]]''. The game versions of the films also used his voice. In 2003, he voice-acted [[Globox]] from ''[[Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc]]''. Leguizamo portrayed Paul in the [[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] thriller film ''[[Vanishing on 7th Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37581/first-images-brad-andersons-the-vanishing-7th-street|title=First Images: Brad Anderson's The Vanishing on 7th Street|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 1995 Leguizamo created, produced, wrote, and starred in the 1995 Latino-oriented variety show called ''[[House of Buggin']]'' on [[Fox Television]]. Some audiences saw this as the Latino version of ''[[In Living Color]]''. The show showcased Leguizamo's well-known ability to assume a wide variety of colorful, energetic characters, but due to poor ratings the show ran less than one season.

During the 2005–06 television season, Leguizamo joined the cast of the show ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing the emotionally disturbed Dr. [[Victor Clemente]], a new attending who is keen on introducing the staff of County General to better ways of treating patients and cutting-edge technology. Clemente, however, was plagued with personal problems and was fired from the hospital near the end of the season. Dr. Clemente's departure from the show was a blessing for Leguizamo. He revealed to [[CraveOnline]] that he was not happy working on the television program. &quot;I was depressed doing ''ER'',&quot; he admitted, &quot;I started gaining weight, I was eating donuts, I started smoking again. I’m eating McDonald's, things that I know when I’m depressed I do. I tried to kill myself internally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bibbiani |first=William |url=http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648255/kill_point_john_leguizamo.html |title=Kill Point: John Leguizamo |publisher=Craveonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he guest starred on ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' as Captain Pirate Piggy. In 2006, Leguizamo starred in the television pilot for ''Edison,'' a 2006 [[CBS]] drama about an Los Angeles [[detective]] (played by Leguizamo) who relied on impersonations and disguises to solve crimes. Other cast members included [[Currie Graham]] and [[Deidrie Henry]]. [[Kevin Rodney Sullivan]] directed from a script by [[Ron Milbauer]] and [[Terri Hughes]]. Leguizamo and [[David Hoberman]] also served as executive producers.

In July 2007, [[Spike TV]] aired their drama series ''[[The Kill Point]]'', starring Leguizamo, [[Donnie Wahlberg]] and [[Michael Hyatt]]. The show was an eight-part series revolving around ex-war veterans whose bank robbery went wrong, thus ending in a hostage situation. Despite high ratings, ''The Kill Point'' was not renewed for a second season.

In 2010, Leguizamo also guest starred on ''[[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'' as himself, rhyming about commas and quotation marks.

In 2012, Leguizamo was cast as Derek Trotter in the American remake of the British BBC sitcom, ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.

===Broadway and theater===
[[File:JohnLeguizamoTIFFSept07.jpg|thumb|upright|left|John Leguizamo at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.]]
In 1991, he also wrote and took part in the [[Off-Broadway]] production ''[[Mambo Mouth]]'', where he played seven different characters. ''Mambo Mouth'' won an [[Obie Award]] and an Outer Critics Award. He was listed as one of 12 &quot;Promising New Actors of 1991&quot; in &quot;John Willis' Screen Worlds Vol. 43&quot;.

In 1993, Leguizamo wrote and participated in ''[[Spic-O-Rama]]'', where he made fun of the stereotyping of Latinos in the United States. The production won a [[Drama Desk Award]] and four [[Cable ACE Award]]s. Both ''Mambo Mouth'' and ''Spic-O-Rama'' were later filmed for presentation on [[HBO]].

In 1998, he debuted on Broadway in the production of ''[[Freak (film)|Freak]]'', which was basically about his whole life experience with his family, how he had a troubled family, and a messed up life. In 2000, it was turned into an [[HBO]] film by director [[Spike Lee]]. The show won him the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]].

In 2002, he wrote and performed in ''[[Sexaholix... A Love Story]]'' which explained his love life and how he started his own family.

In June 2010, Leguizamo opened his semi-autobiographical one-man theater show, ''Klass Klown'' (later renamed ''Ghetto Klown''), based on his memoir ''Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas, and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life''. After the show ran at various theaters in the [[United States]] and Leguizamo performed an 'unplugged' version of it under the title ''John Leguizamo Warms Up'' at a [[Chicago]] theater, it opened on Broadway in March 2011 at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hurwitt|first=Robert|title=John Leguizamo goes deeper, darker in 'Klown'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/John-Leguizamo-goes-deeper-darker-in-Klown-3262990.php|accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|title=A Queens Guy Toughs It Out in Hollywood|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/theater/reviews/john-leguizamos-new-solo-show-ghetto-klown-review.html|accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleyrep.org/season/0910/4880.asp |title=John Leguizamo: Klass Klown |publisher=Berkeleyrep.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/John_Leguizamo_to_Play_Lyceum_Theatre_on_Broadway_Starting_Feb_21_20101229|title=John Leguizamo to Play Lyceum Theatre on Broadway Starting Feb. 21|publisher=BroadwayWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, about Leguizamo's path from obscurity to stardrom, opened to many positive reviews and was extended through July 10, 2011. A CD of the show was released. In 2011, Leguizamo received the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding Solo Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Leguizamo honored for one-man play &quot;Ghetto Klown&quot;|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/05/17/john-leguizamo-honored-man-play-ghetto-klown/|work=Fox News Latino|accessdate=8 August 2011|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Solo Performance for his performance in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/151111-Drama-Desk-Awards-Go-to-Book-of-Mormon-Normal-Heart-War-Horse-Sutton-Foster-Norbert-Leo-Butz |title=Drama Desk Awards Go to Book of Mormon, Normal Heart, War Horse, Sutton Foster, Norbert Leo Butz |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, Leguizamo began an international tour of ''Ghetto Klown'' in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wada|first=Karen|title=John Leguizamo and 'Ghetto Klown' coming to the Ricardo Montalban Theatre|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/07/john-leguizamos-ghetto-klown-is-coming-to-the-ricardo-montalban-theatre.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2012, [[PBS]] debuted ''Tales From a Ghetto Klown,'' a documentary about Leguizamo's life and the show's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aucoin|first=Don|title=In ‘Tales From a Ghetto Klown,’ Broadway minus the glitz|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/2012/07/13/john-leguizamo-restless-introspection-drives-tales-from-ghetto-klown/INZkN3xT0ndhzofi8Y9guM/story.html|newspaper=Boston.com (The Boston Globe)|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On record===
''John Leguizamo LIVE'' (2001) on RCA Records. The live CD features the best of Leguizamo's stage routines at the time. Leguizamo gives his audience a primer on the history and culture of Latinos in America. The story starts with the dubious tale of the mating of an Inca princess with a Spanish conquistador, thus creating the original dysfunctional Latin family with Leguizamo providing all the voices.

The CD includes a musical intermission, with two salsa/hip-hop tunes, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Some&quot;. The Mac-and-PC compatible enhanced CD includes footage from John on tour at various US locations and two interactive games; &quot;Spanish Fly Pick-Up Line&quot;, which lets the person at the keyboard click to choose an appropriate response to a number cheesy pickup lines, delivered by an animated version of Leguizamo, and &quot;Six Degrees of Leguizamo&quot;, a drag-and-drop brain-teaser modeled on the &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; phenomena. The number of correct answer sequences to this game attest to the Leguizamo's prolific career.

==Personal life==
Leguizamo married Justine Maurer on June 28, 2003, in a Catholic-Jewish ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140534,00.html|title=Knot Ready|work=www.people.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, daughter Allegra Sky (born in 1999) and son Lucas Ryder  (born in 2000), and live in [[Manhattan]]. In 2008, Leguizamo received the [[Rita Moreno]] HOLA Award for Excellence from the [[Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors]] (HOLA). He was a recipient of the 2011 [http://home2.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/050111_miny_awards_2011announcement.shtml Made in NY Award] from the [[City of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leguizamo Among Honorees For MADE IN NY Awards |url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Leguizamo-Among-Honorees-For-MADE-IN-NY-Awards-20110512|work=Broadway World|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Damon, John Leguizamo, Late Sidney Lumet Honored With 'Made in NY' Awards|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-john-leguizamo-late-195388|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=9 August 2011|first=Georg|last=Szalai|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnicity===
On June 10, 2011, Alberto Leguizamo, John's father, declared in an interview published in a New York Hispanic newspaper ''El Diaro Newspaper'', that he (the father) was not Puerto Rican, that he is Colombian and therefore his son (John) was not half Puerto Rican as he has always stated.&lt;ref name=&quot;FN&quot;/&gt; John Leguizamo had always declared that he was Puerto Rican on his father's side which was one of the reasons that he was selected as the [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]] Global Ambassador of the Arts. In response to his father's allegations, Leguizamo stated that his grandfather was of Puerto Rican descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;FN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gratereaux|first=Alexandra|title=Leguizamo’s Dad: John's Not Puerto Rican!|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/06/10/leguizamos-dad-johns-not-puerto-rican/|work=[[Fox News Latino]]|accessdate=2011-09-08|date=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the National Puerto Rican Day Parade has stated that Leguizamo would not be stripped of his ambassadorship. Leguizamo marched in the parade on June 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huge crowd for Puerto Rican parade|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8184052|work=[[Eyewitness News]]|publisher=[[WABC-TV]]|date=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs===
In October 2006, Leguizamo's memoir, ''Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life'', was released. During an interview on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Leguizamo stated that his memoir was very frank about odd experiences involving other celebrities and co-stars he had worked with. He stated that working with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' was one of the most enjoyable experiences he had as an actor. He also said that Arnold's accent let him say things that others would think were [[sexist]] or [[homophobic]] if said by someone else, that [[Steven Seagal]] was an egotist with [[diva]] tendencies, [[Kurt Russell]] continuously called him a &quot;faggot&quot;, and that [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was a &quot;patron of prostitutes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/node/9486 |title=Fresh Intelligence : Radar Online : John Leguizamo Trashes Everyone He's Ever Worked With |publisher=Radar Online |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, Leguizamo has produced over 10 films (including the film ''[[Piñero (movie)|Piñero]]''), starred or co-starred in over 75 films, starred on Broadway in several productions winning several awards, made over a dozen TV guest appearances and has helped produce or star in many other similar television shows.

He attended Vilas Grammar School, and graduated from [[El Paso High School]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpasotimes.typepad.com/morgue/2008/07/hometown-star-3.html Tales from the Morgue: Hometown stars – F.

Retrieved on 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[gang]] member during his teenage years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1&quot; /&gt; He attended Texas Western College (later named [[University of Texas at El Paso]]), where he was given the best actor award by [[Alpha Psi Omega]] for his portrayal of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] Nocona in ''Comanche Eagle'' during the 1959–60 season. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], then studied acting under [[Uta Hagen]] in [[New York City]]. He began his acting career on the stage, debuting in a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] production of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit and Other Plays|The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]''.

== Career ==
Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in the [[George C. Scott]] comedy ''[[They Might Be Giants (film)|They Might Be Giants]]'' (1971). Abraham can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with [[Al Pacino]] in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Serpico]]'' (1973), and in television roles including the bad guy in one third-season episode of ''[[Kojak (TV series)|Kojak]]''. He played a cab driver in the theatrical version of ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' (1975), a mechanic in the theatrical version of ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1975), and one of the police officers in the film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976) who arrests the [[Watergate]] burglars at the offices of the [[Democratic National Headquarters]].

Until his acclaimed role in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), Abraham was perhaps best known to audiences as a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for [[Fruit of the Loom]] underwear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800015692/bio F. Murray Abraham Biography – Yahoo! Movies]. Movies.yahoo.com. Retrieved on 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with Pacino again in the gangster film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' in 1983, playing drug dealer [[Omar Suárez]].

Abraham won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as [[Antonio Salieri]] in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), an award for which [[Tom Hulce]], playing [[Mozart]] in that movie, had also been nominated.

Immediately after ''Amadeus'', he appeared in ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' (1986), in which he played [[Bernardo Gui]], nemesis to [[Sean Connery]]'s William of Baskerville. His director on the film, [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], has described Abraham - perhaps jokingly - as an &quot;egomaniac&quot; on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Annaud, ''The Name of the Rose'', DVD commentary, Warner Home Video, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Amadeus'', he has mainly focused on classical theatre, and has starred in many [[Shakespearean]] productions such as ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. He was highlighted in many other plays by the likes of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and played the lead in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' (for which he received an [[Obie Award]]).

He is also known for his roles in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), Ahdar Ru'afo in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' (1998), and [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), where he once again played nemesis to Connery.

Abraham has focused on stage work throughout his career, giving notable performances as Pozzo in [[Mike Nichols]]'s production of ''[[Waiting for Godot]],'' Malvolio in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' for the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], and [[Shylock]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' for the [[Off Broadway]] Theatre For A New Audience (TFANA) in March 2007, which was performed at the Duke Theatre in New York and also at The Swan Theatre, part of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. He reprised this role in February 2011, when he replaced [[Al Pacino]] in the Public Theater's production. In the 1997/98 Broadway season he starred in the new chamber musical ''[[Triumph of Love]]'' opposite [[Betty Buckley]], based on [[Marivaux]]'s classic comedy. The production did not find a large audience, running 85 performances, after its pre-opening preview period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4756 The official source for Broadway Information]. IBDB. Retrieved on 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham most recently made a guest appearance on the popular television series ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'', on which he played an angel, Matthew and the ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'', on which he played Dr. Theodore Nichols, father of Det. Zach Nichols. Additionally, Abraham has worked as the primary narrator for the [[PBS]] series ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' for 32 episodes spanning 2007–2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000719/filmoseries#tt0083452 Filmography by TV series for F. Murray Abraham]. imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

F. Murray Abraham has also played Father Marco D'Aviano, the Capuchin Franciscan friar, advisor of Emperor Leopold I of Austria in the movie ''Battle of Vienna'', an Italian movie in English by director Renzo Martinelli, released in Europe in 2012.

== Oscar jinx ==
Abraham's relatively low-profile film career subsequent to his [[Academy Award]] has been widely considered an example of the &quot;Oscar [[jinx]]&quot;. According to film critic [[Leonard Maltin]], professional failure following an early success is referred to in [[Hollywood]] circles as the &quot;F. Murray Abraham syndrome&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081207113221/http://www.film.com/features/story/winning-oscar-curse-or-blessing/13303376 Is winning an Oscar a curse or a blessing?] film.com (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham rejected this notion and told Maltin:&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Oscar is the single most important event of my career. I have dined with kings, shared equal billing with my idols, lectured at [[Harvard]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. If this is a jinx, I'll take two.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In the same interview, Abraham said:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Even though I won the Oscar, I can still take the subway in [[New York]], and nobody recognizes me. Some [[actors]] might find that disconcerting, but I find it refreshing.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Personal life ==
Abraham has been married to Kate Hannan since 1962; they have two children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070928155106/http://www.amadeusimmortal.com/movie/abraham.php The Movie : F. Murray Abraham]. amadeusimmortal.com&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught Theater at [[Brooklyn College]].

In January 2010, Abraham was the on-the-scene hero of a real-life crime scene at the Classic Stage Company in New York, when he traded blows with a thief in the dressing room area during a public rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/f-murray-abraham-action-hero/ | work=The New York Times | title=F.

Raised in the [[Jackson Heights]] section of [[Queens]], New York City,&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglas&quot; /&gt; Richardson later served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. He then earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from [[Columbia University]], and studied at the [[University of Munich]].

Richardson's next two plays, ''Lorenzo'' (1963) and ''Xmas in Las Vegas'' (1965), were produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but were critical and commercial failures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=aQqOKWmjdQUC&amp;pg=PA1138&amp;lpg=PA1138&amp;dq=%22Jack+Richardson%22+prodigal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dzYn_BE5Cw&amp;sig=KGdRk32ZMvpy9TeWGfcapsLjAKw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=caSGTdKREJH4gAeV7L3dCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jack%20Richardson%22%20prodigal&amp;f=false  &quot;Richardson, Jack (1935-)&quot;, The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama, vol. 2, p. 1138 (2007) (retrieved from Google Books).]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s, Richardson wrote dramatic criticism and essays for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', as well as two novels: ''The Prison Life of Harris Filmore'' (1965) and ''Memoir of a Gambler'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=aQqOKWmjdQUC&amp;pg=PA1138&amp;lpg=PA1138&amp;dq=%22Jack+Richardson%22+prodigal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dzYn_BE5Cw&amp;sig=KGdRk32ZMvpy9TeWGfcapsLjAKw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=caSGTdKREJH4gAeV7L3dCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jack%20Richardson%22%20prodigal&amp;f=false  &quot;Richardson, Jack (1935-)&quot;, The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama, vol. 2, p. 1138 (2007) (retrieved from Google Books).]&lt;/ref&gt;

He first came to national attention as Dr. Jack Morrison in the [[Medical Drama|medical drama]] ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' from 1982 to 1988. Morse continued his movie career with roles in ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'', ''[[The Indian Runner]]'', ''[[The Negotiator]]'', ''[[Contact (film)|Contact]]'', ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]'', ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'', ''[[The Crossing Guard]]'', ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', ''[[Extreme Measures]]'', ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[16 Blocks]]'', and ''[[Hounddog (film)|Hounddog]]''. 

In 2006, Morse had a recurring role as Detective [[Michael Tritter]] on the medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' for which he received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination. Morse portrayed [[George Washington]] in the 2008 [[HBO]] [[Miniseries]] ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]'', which garnered him a second Emmy nomination. Morse has received acclaim for his portrayal of Uncle Peck on the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''[[How I Learned to Drive]]'' for which he earned a [[Drama Desk Awards|Drama Desk]] and [[Obie Awards|Obie Award]]. He also had success on Broadway, portraying James &quot;Sharky&quot; Harkin in ''[[The Seafarer (play)|The Seafarer]]''. As of 2011, Morse is a regular on the HBO series, ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', where he plays an honest police officer in a corrupt New Orleans police department.

==Early life==
Morse was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] and raised in nearby [[Hamilton, Massachusetts]], the son of Jacquelyn, a school teacher, and Charles Morse, a sales manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/David-Morse.html|publisher=Filmreference|title=David Morse Biography (1953–)|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three younger sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;site&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmorse.org/bio/|title=''David Morse'' Biography|publisher=Unofficial David Morse website|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name, Bowditch, comes from mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]].&lt;ref name=sto&gt;{{Cite news|title=Patricia Sheridan's Breakfast With ...

==Career==
Morse studied acting at the [[William Esper Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycastings.com/Resources_s/ViewResourceDetail.asp?Qn=98|title=William Esper Studio for Acting|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his acting career in the theatre as a player for the Boston Repertory Theatre in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;site&quot; /&gt; He spent some time in New York's theatre community in the early 1980s before moving into television and film.&lt;ref name=&quot;site&quot; /&gt; During that time, Morse was listed as one of the twelve most &quot;Promising New Actors of 1980&quot; in [[John A. Willis|John Willis]]' Screen World, Vol. 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |first=John |authorlink=John A. Willis |title=1981 Film Annual Screen World |origdate=1981-01-01|accessdate=August 6, 2008 |series=Screen World |volume=32 |publisher=Crown |isbn=05849707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse's big break came in 1982 when he was cast in the television medical drama ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. Morse played Dr. Jack &quot;Boomer&quot; Morrison, a young physician who is forced to deal with the death of his wife and the struggles of a single parent professional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mustv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert J.|last=Thompson|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/stelsewhere/stelsewhere.htm|title=St. Elsewhere|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications|The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morse appeared in a number of supporting roles following the finale of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in 1988. The actor is quoted as saying &quot;I [...] made the decision [that] I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. I had to find roles that were different from what I had been doing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; His turn in &quot;[[Desperate Hours]]&quot; as antagonist showed a darker Morse.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; Morse later starred in ''[[The Indian Runner]]'' and ''[[The Crossing Guard]]'', written and directed by then novice auteur and writer [[Sean Penn]]. So far, Morse has appeared in three adaptations of [[Stephen King]] stories: ''[[The Langoliers]]'', ''[[Hearts in Atlantis (film)|Hearts in Atlantis]]'', and ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]''. Additionally Morse was a guest star on ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', playing the racist cousin of [[Tim Bayliss|Detective Tim Bayliss]] ([[Kyle Secor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Colors |episodelink=List of Homicide: Life on the Street episodes |series=Homicide: Life on the Street |serieslink=Homicide: Life on the Street |credits=Fontana, Tom; Attanasio, Paul; Mark, Bonnie |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=1995-04-28 |season=3 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Morse starred as Mike Olshansky, an ex-Philadelphia police officer turned cab driver, in the television movie ''Hack''. The movie was so well received that a television series was created (also with the title ''[[Hack (American TV series)|Hack]]''), which ran from 2002 to 2004. For his role in the 2002 crime-drama film ''[[Double Vision (2002 film)|Shuang Tong]]'', Morse was nominated as &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; in the [[Golden Horse Awards]], the first nomination ever for an English-speaking actor. His most recent big-screen appearance was as questionable neighbor Mr. Turner in the 2007 release ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]''. In a review of this film, film critic and commentator [[John Podhoretz]] wrote that Morse is a &quot;largely unsung character actor who enlivens and deepens every movie fortunate enough to have him in the cast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|pages=46–47|first=John|last=Podhoretz|authorlink=John Podhoretz|title=Hitchcock Lite; Entertaining, yes, but Shia LaBeouf is no James Stewart|work=review on [[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]|publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DavidMorse-1.jpg|thumb|right|Morse in 2005.]]
In 2006, Morse received a phone call from [[David Shore]], whom he had previously worked with on ''[[Hack (American TV series)|Hack]]'', who asked him if he would be interested in having a guest role on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. When Morse watched the show, he could not understand why people watched the show, because, in his words, &quot;This House guy is a total jerk&quot;. But when he told some of his friends, their excited reactions convinced Morse to take the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;AV&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Noel |last=Murray |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/random_roles_david_morse?utm_source=imdb_rss_1|title=Random Roles: David Morse|publisher=The A.V. club|accessdate=July 26, 2008|subjectlink=David Morse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse portrayed [[Michael Tritter]], a detective with a vendetta against [[Gregory House]]. Morse earned his first [[Emmy Award]] nomination for his work on the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;07emmynoms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/2007pt/59thnominations.php |title=The 59th Primetime Emmy Awards and Creative Arts Emmy Awards Nominees are... |accessdate=March 2, 2008 |publisher=''[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Morse portrayed [[George Washington]] in the [[HBO]] mini-series ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]'', for which his nose was made bigger. Morse commented: &quot;The first thing that comes to mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and thinking 'This man's face is so commanding', and I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went, 'Wow, that's [[George Washington|Washington]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AV&quot; /&gt; Morse's portrayal earned him his second [[Emmy Award]] nomination. He is currently &quot;reprising&quot; the role of [[George Washington]], in voice only, as part of the [[The Hall of Presidents]] show in the [[Magic Kingdom]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]].

Morse stated that out of all of the films he has done, his favorites are ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast Chat: David Morse|work=Actor David Morse of 'The Green Mile' and 'Disturbia' is starring on Broadway in 'The Seafarer.'|first=Joseph V.|last=Amodio|date=February 24, 2008|publisher=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crossing Guard]]'', and ''[[The Indian Runner]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AV&quot; /&gt;

In 2010, Morse guest starred in two episodes of the HBO drama series, ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', as Lt. Terry Colson of the New Orleans Police Department. Morse was promoted to series regular starting with season two of the show, which began in April 2011.

In 2011, Morse wan the best actor award at [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival|Karlovy Vary IFF]] for his role in [[Collaborator (film)|Collaborator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KarlovyPrizesOnVariety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2011/film/news/restoration-wins-at-karlovy-vary-1118039644/ |title=‘Restoration’ wins at Karlovy Vary | publisher=Variety | accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Morse was cast as a &quot;prisoner living in an abandoned jail&quot; in the upcoming film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]''.

===Theatre===
In addition to his film and television career, Morse has continued to appear on stage. For his performance in the 1997 Off-Broadway production of [[Paula Vogel|Paula Vogel's]] [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize-winning]] drama ''[[How I Learned to Drive]]'', he received an [[Obie Award]], a [[Drama League Award]], a [[Drama Desk Award]], and a [[Lucille Lortel Award]]. That same year Morse played Father Barry in the play adaptation of ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' along with [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. The play only ran for a week, with just eight performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBDB1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4298|title=On the Waterfront|publisher=[[The Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2008, Morse appeared on Broadway in [[Conor McPherson|Conor McPherson's]] ''[[The Seafarer (play)|The Seafarer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/we_ask_david_morse_of_the_seaf.html|title=We Ask David Morse of ‘The Seafarer’ Who's Tougher: The Devil or House?|author=Latifi, Sadia|date=June 12, 2007|publisher=''[[New York Magazine]]''|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=462798|title=The Seafarer|publisher=[[The Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also been nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]].

==Early life==
Mulgrew was born in 1955 in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], into an [[Irish American|Irish]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.totallykate.com/catholicd/catholicd.html|title=Kate Mulgrew's One-Woman Show|publisher=[[Catholic Digest]]|work=Totally Kate|date=2003-08-|quote = Raised in an Irish-Catholic family,...|accessdate=August 12, 2010|first=Steven|last=Slosberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Thomas James &quot;T.J.&quot; Mulgrew II, a [[General Contractor|contractor]], and Joan Virginia Mulgrew (née Kiernan), an [[painting|artist and painter]]. She attended [[Wahlert High School]] in Dubuque.&lt;ref name=mulgrewbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totallykate.com/bio.htm |title=Kate Mulgrew |work=TotallyKate.com |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 17, she was accepted at the [[Stella Adler]] Conservatory of Acting in conjunction with [[New York University]] in [[New York City]]. Mulgrew left NYU after one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;captains&quot;&gt;{{cite video| date=July 22, 2011| title=The Captains| publisher=Le Big Boss Productions| people=William Shatner, Writer, Director| medium=Television production| network=[[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, to earn money while in New York Mulgrew was employed as a [[waitress]] at Friar Tuck, a now defunct restaurant previously at 914 [[Third Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ctYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=3rd+ave+new+york+friar+tuck's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wKGXQjzHoX&amp;sig=zb9igtpSSytR8FSWWmuueVG7dHU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1P3gTpHHBaXgiAL21anwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=3rd%20ave%20new%20york%20friar%20tuck's&amp;f=false| date=August 5, 1968| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| page=33| author=Sally Beauman| publisher=[[Google Books]]| accessdate=March 1, 2012| title=The Emergence of the Sidewalk Cafe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Her early career included portraying Mary Ryan for two years on the ABC soap ''Ryan's Hope'' (1975) She became a fan favorite and is still associated with the show long after its cancellation. Mulgrew remains friends with former co-star [[Ilene Kristen]] and presented a special [[Soap Opera Digest Award]] to ''Ryan's Hope'' creator [[Claire Labine]] in 1995. While in ''Ryan's Hope'' she also played the role of &quot;Emily&quot; in the American Shakespeare Theatre production of ''Our Town'' in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. In 1979, she played Kate Columbo in ''[[Columbo (TV series)#Mrs. Columbo spin-off|Mrs. Columbo]]'', a spin-off of the popular detective series, created specifically for her, which lasted 13 episodes. 

In 1986, she appeared on ''[[Cheers]]'' as Janet Eldridge. In 1992, Kate appeared on ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' as Hillary Wheaton, a [[Toronto]]-based anchorwoman brought in to replace Murphy Brown during her pregnancy, but who turned out to have the same problem with alcoholism as Brown had previously dealt with at the beginning of the series.

In 1993, Mulgrew separated from her husband, Robert H. Egan, to whom she had been married for 12 years. In 1995, the divorce became final, and she was on the verge of selling her house and moving into a less-expensive apartment in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] when she received a call to take the part of Captain Kathryn Janeway in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. Mulgrew made history in the ''Star Trek'' franchise when she became the first female captain as a series regular in a leading role. ''Voyager'' was the first show broadcast on the new [[UPN]] channel, the only series renewed after the channel's first programming season, and its only show to run for seven seasons, making it the UPN's longest running. Mulgrew won the Saturn Award for &quot;Best TV Actress&quot; in 1998 for her performances as Janeway. Mulgrew also voiced the character of Janeway in the [[PS2]] and PC game ''[[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force 2]]''. In recent years, Mulgrew kept active in doing voice-over work for video games, her latest roles were of Flemeth in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' video game series.

During ''Voyager'' she also played the role of Titania in the animated series, ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' and Victoria Riddler in ''[[Riddler's Moon]]'', a made for TV movie. Mulgrew provided the voice of Janeway for ''Star Trek: Captain's Chair'', a virtual-reality tour of various Star Fleet vessels, for home computers.

===''Star Trek: Voyager''===
Mulgrew auditioned for the role of the captain, named Kathryn Janeway, when producers announced casting for ''Star Trek: Voyager''.  She initially submitted a videotaped audition, which she made in New York City in August 1994. However she was unhappy with this audition and auditioned in person a few weeks later. That day, film actress [[Geneviève Bujold]] was selected to play Janeway, but left the role after only two days of filming, due to the demanding production schedule required for a television show.&lt;ref name=&quot;meisler19940915&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/15/arts/real-star-trek-drama-enlisting-new-skipper.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm| title=Real 'Star Trek' Drama: Enlisting New Skipper| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| date=September 15, 1994| accessdate=May 24, 2011| author=Andy Meisler}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

About her years on ''Voyager'', Mulgrew said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm proud of it. It was difficult; it was hard work. I'm proud of the work because I think I made some little difference in women in [[science]]. I grew to really love ''Star Trek: Voyager'', and out of a cast of nine, I've made three great friends, I managed to raise two children. I think, &quot;It's good. I used myself well.&quot; Speaking about the best and worst part about playing a Star Trek captain, she said: &quot;The best thing was simply the privilege and the challenge of being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had ''Star Trek'' not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news| work=Star Trek Magazine| title=Deep Space Five!| date=September/October 2006, issue #1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-''Star Trek''===
After ''Voyager'' came to the end of the full seven seasons, Mulgrew returned to theater and starred in a one-woman play called ''[[Tea at Five]]'', a monologue reminiscence based on [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s memoir ''Me: Stories of My Life''. ''[[Tea at Five]]'' was a critical success and Mulgrew received two awards, one from Carbonell (best actress) and the other from Broadway.com (Audience Award for Favorite Solo Performance). In 2006, Mulgrew performed in ''The Exonerated'' at the Riverside Studios located in London, England. In the spring of 2007, she appeared in the NBC television series ''[[The Black Donnellys]]'' as Helen Donnelly which lasted for one season. She also performed the lead role in an off-Broadway production called ''Our Leading Lady'' written by [[Charles Busch]] in which she earned a nomination from the Drama League for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;mania&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=2007 Drama League Award Winners Announced| url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city/news/05-2007/2007-drama-league-award-winners-announced_10744.html| author=Brian Scott Lipton| publisher=Theatre Mania| date=May 11, 2007| accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Mulgrew played Clytemnestra in New York for Charles L. Mee's ''Iphigenia 2.0''. She won the [[Obie Award]] for outstanding performance. In June 2008, Mulgrew appeared in ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' on Broadway, playing Hesther Saloman, a public official who is empathetic toward the play's central character. The play opened on September 5, 2008 for a strictly limited 22-week engagement through February 8, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Mulgrew Will Join Radcliffe and Griffiths for Broadway's &quot;Equus&quot;| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118970-Mulgrew-Will-Join-Radcliffe-and-Griffiths-for-Broadways-Equus| date=June 25, 2008| author=Andrew Gans| work=[[Playbill]]| publisher=Playbill.com| accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, Mulgrew filmed the 30-minute courtroom drama ''The Response'' which is based on actual transcripts of the Guantanamo Bay tribunals.  It was researched and fully vetted in conjunction with the University of Maryland School of Law and was shot in three days.  Mulgrew portrays Colonel Sims and she, the other cast members and crew agreed to defer their salaries to cover the production costs. The film has been screened at a number of sites and is available on DVD.&lt;ref name=&quot;response&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=See the Film| url=http://www.theresponsemovie.com/see-the-film/home.html| publisher=Look at the Moon Productions| accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mulgrew returned to television in the NBC medical series, ''[[Mercy (TV series)|Mercy]]'' playing the recurring role of Jeannie Flanagan (the mother of the show's lead, Veronica).&lt;ref name=&quot;mercy&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= Mulgrew Set for New NBC Hospital Series &quot;Mercy&quot;| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/132386-Mulgrew-Set-for-New-NBC-Hospital-Series-Mercy| author=Adam Hetrick| date=August 31, 2009| work=Playbill| publisher=Playbill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due for release in 2010 is the film ''The Best and the Brightest'', a comedy based in the world of New York City's elite private kindergartens. Mulgrew will play The Player's wife. Also in development is the film ''The Incredible Story of Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon''.

In a message to her fans on her official website she said, &quot;I am looking for a play and hope that it will come to me before I become irritated. But I realize, even in this wish, that I have been a little spoiled as an actress and that in the waiting there is a kind of lovely discipline.&quot;

In 2010, Kate Mulgrew starred as Cleopatra in William Shakepeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' at [[Hartford Stage]]. As of July 2011, she has appeared in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''. Also in 2011, Mulgrew appeared in the feature length documentary ''[[The Captains (film)|The Captains]]''. The film, written and directed by [[William Shatner]], follows Shatner as he interviews each of the other actors who played a [[Starfleet]] [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|captain]] within the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;shatner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive Clips from William Shatner's 'The Captains'|url=http://trekmovie.com/2011/07/18/exclusive-clips-from-william-shatners-the-captains-how-to-watch-doc-for-free-online/| publisher=Trekmovie.com| date=July 18, 2011| author=Anthony Pascale}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same year, she guest starred on the third season of the series ''[[Warehouse 13]]''.

==Early life==
{{further|Carradine family}}

Plimpton was born '''Martha Campbell Carradine''' and raised in New York City, the daughter of actors [[Keith Carradine]] and [[Shelley Plimpton]]. Her parents met while performing in the original Broadway run of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Her paternal grandfather was actor [[John Carradine]] and she is the niece of [[Robert Carradine|Robert]] and [[David Carradine]]. She is a &quot;very distant&quot; cousin of writer and editor [[George Plimpton]],&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cindy [http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/item_Rf5rKYyacY8ARBiZIvi4lM;jsessionid=ADC07979FC73100AED23F5A459D3E9AE &quot;Cousins Who Miss, Kiss, Hiss and Dismiss&quot;] ''The New York Post,'' July 24, 2009 &quot;Martha Plimpton on cousin George Plimpton: &quot;There was no Plimpton competition. We encouraged each other. People see the Plimptons as stodgy, but there's this whole other Plimpton branch that's different. We're not all bankers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dayton |url=http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/NYT9-13-70.html |title=New York Times 9-13-70 |publisher=Orlok.com |date=September 13, 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite the different spelling, cartoonist [[Bill Plympton]].&lt;ref&gt;Plympton, Bill http://www.plymptoons.com/scrapbook/scrap101609.html &quot;But through my beautiful and talented cousin, Martha Plimpton (the star of Broadway), David, her uncle, was kind enough to do a starring voice in my wonderful film &quot;Hair High.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Professional Children's School]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Ryzik, Melena. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/theater/25ryzi.html &quot;So Odd, but Lately in Classic Fashion&quot;], ''The New York Times'', November 25, 2007. Retrieved November 25, 2007. &quot;ON a break from rehearsals for “Cymbeline” at Lincoln Center Martha Plimpton dashed outside for a cigarette and immediately ran into a classmate from her alma mater, the nearby Professional Children’s School.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Her first stage appearance was when her mother brought her on stage in costume for the curtain call of the short-lived Broadway play ''The Leaf People''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americantheatrewing.org/seminars/detail/performance_04_04 &quot;Working in the Theatre&quot;] – April 2004 panel discussion at American Theatre Wing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1980s===
Plimpton began her career in modeling, securing an early 1980s campaign for [[Calvin Klein]], making an impression as a sophisticated but tomboyish little girl. She made her screen debut in 1981, when at the age of 11 she had a small part in the film ''[[Rollover (film)|Rollover]]''. In 1984, she appeared in the Deep South independent drama ''[[The River Rat]]'' opposite [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. Her breakthrough performance was as Stef Steinbrenner in the 1985 feature film ''[[The Goonies]]''. She also appeared that year in a featured role on the television sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]''.

This began a trend of Plimpton being typecast in the role of a rebellious tomboy for several years, beginning with her critically lauded performance as the Reverend Spellgood ([[Andre Gregory]])'s daughter in the 1986 film ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', starring [[Harrison Ford]]. The critically praised but commercially unsuccessful 1987 film ''[[Shy People]]'' (co-starred with [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]]) was followed by a performance in the 1988 ensemble comedy ''[[Stars and Bars (film)|Stars and Bars]].'' This was released shortly before ''[[Running on Empty (1988 film)|Running on Empty]]'', an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated film starring [[River Phoenix]], for which she was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]].

She began what became a career trend, mixing small [[independent film]] appearances with supporting roles in big-budget films. She appeared in the 1989 [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Another Woman]]''; that year, she co-starred with [[Jami Gertz]] as a cancer patient in the German film ''[[Zwei Frauen]]'' (released in America as ''Silence Like Glass''). The film was nominated for Outstanding Feature Film at the [[German Film Awards]]. Plimpton shaved her head bald to play a cancer patient in ''Zwei Frauen,'' and her reputation for playing rebellious teenagers secured her the role of the indignant teenage daughter (who shaves her head) of [[Dianne Wiest]] in ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]].''  Plimpton appeared alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] (then credited as Leaf Phoenix), who portrayed her on-screen brother. ''Parenthood'' grossed over $126 million and received two [[Academy Award]] nominations, making it her most successful movie performance to date since ''The Goonies.''

===1990s===
In 1991, Plimpton appeared in the [[Robert De Niro]] film ''[[Stanley &amp; Iris]]'' in a supporting role. She also appeared in TV movie ''[[A Woman At War]]'' as the lead Helene Moskiewicz alongside Eric Stolz.

In 1992, Plimpton appeared as a lesbian terrorist in the independent film ''[[Inside Monkey Zetterland]]''. She played the starring role in the film ''[[Samantha (movie)|Samantha]]''.

The success of ''Samantha'' garnered Plimpton a variety of roles in 1993. She appeared with [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]], in the television film ''[[Daybreak (1993 TV movie)|Daybreak]]'' and was a part of the mostly improvised television film ''[[Chantilly Lace (film)|Chantilly Lace]]''. She had a featured role in the big-budget films ''[[Josh and S.A.M.]]'' and played the lead in the critically blasted film adaptation of the [[Carolyn Chute]] novel ''[[The Beans of Egypt, Maine (movie)|The Beans of Egypt, Maine]]''. Plimpton also appeared that year as herself in the independent film ''[[My Life's in Turnaround]]'', a movie about filmmakers trying to make a movie.
Plimpton continued to make appearances in featured roles in both independent films and mainstream movies from 1994 through 1997, most notably as a close friend of radical feminist [[Valerie Solanas]] in the film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]''.

In 1997, the [[Showtime Network]] cast Plimpton as the female lead in a television film called ''[[The Defenders: Payback]]''. The show was a retooling of the classic television show by the same name, and the characters were descendants of character Lawrence Preston, a role reprised by actor [[E.G. Marshall]]. The intent was to spin the program off into a series akin to ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', but Marshall died in 1998. Two additional episodes (''[[The Defenders: Choice of Evils]]'' and ''[[The Defenders: Taking the First]]'') were aired as specials that year. The decision was made to not continue production (despite high ratings and critical praise) due to Marshall's death. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Plimpton became involved with The [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] in Chicago where she appeared in ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (2001) among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steppenwolf.org/ensemble/members/details.aspx?id=28 Steppenwolf Theatre website] company list&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 she appeared in the [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] film ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]''; the film was lambasted but Plimpton's work was praised. This also occurred with her appearance in the 1999 ''[[200 Cigarettes]]''. In 1999, Plimpton had a recurring role in the television drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' as Meg Corwyn.

===2000s===
In 2001, she co-starred with [[Jacqueline Bisset]] in ''[[The Sleepy Time Gal]]'', which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In 2002, she appeared in the documentary film ''[[Searching for Debra Winger]]'' and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/martha-plimpton |title=Martha Plimpton Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for her guest appearance on the television drama ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. Plimpton was the voice of Miss Crumbles in the 2004 animated film ''[[Hair High]]'' by [[Bill Plympton]]. In 2004, she also guest-starred on an episode of ''[[7th Heaven]]''; she received her first writing credit for a different episode of the show that year entitled &quot;Red Socks&quot;. She continues to act in television, film and on stage. She had a recurring role on the NBC show ''[[Surface (TV series)|Surface]]'' (2005–06). {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Martha Plimpton 2009.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plimpton attending the [[63rd Tony Awards]], 2009]]

From October 2006 until May 2007, she was in ''[[The Coast of Utopia]]'', a trilogy of plays by Tom Stoppard that played at the [[Lincoln Center]]. For her work in this play she won a [[Drama Desk Award]] and was nominated for a [[Tony award]]. In October 2007 Plimpton completed a starring role in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in New York City. She then began rehearsals for the play ''[[Cymbeline]]''. She co-founded a production company, [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=174853041 ''Everything is Horrible''], which has produced a number of short films for the internet.

Plimpton received her second nomination for a [[Tony Award]] in 2008, Best Performance by a Featured Actress In a Play, for her work in ''[[Top Girls]]'' at the [[Biltmore Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html |title=– The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards |publisher=Tonyawards.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, she earned rave reviews as Gladys Bumps in the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] production of the classical [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' on Broadway and garnered her third consecutive Tony nomination, this time for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

Plimpton appeared in the 2008 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' photo issue spread as one of &quot;The Hardest Working Actors In Showbiz.&quot; In the spread she appears with [[Lance Reddick]], [[Celia Weston]], [[John Slattery]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Lynn Cohen]], [[Matt Servitto]] and [[Bob Balaban]]. Plimpton says in the write-up about her &quot;I went to jury duty the other day, and somebody said, 'You always play drug addicts!' I've played a few on TV, and I imagine because the shows get replayed, it seems like more. But yeah, people tend to see me as this pregnant teenage heroin addict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20232072_2,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=The Hardest Working Actors in Showbiz – EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In November 2009, Plimpton signed on as a main cast member on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Raising Hope]]''. The show premiered on September 21, 2010, receiving strong reviews for both Plimpton and the pilot itself. The ''[[New York Times]]'' called ''Raising Hope'' &quot;the most promising&quot; of &quot;the best new fall shows,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/arts/television/12stanley.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=raising%20hope&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Alessandra | last=Stanley | title=‘Raising Hope' and ‘Outsourced' Embrace Malaise | date=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said &quot;Plimpton isn't the only reason 'Raising Hope' could be the best new sitcom of the season, but she is the main reason.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/arts/television/21hope.html?scp=6&amp;sq=raising%20hope&amp;st=cse ''New York Times'' review of ''Raising Hope'']&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2011, Plimpton was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] for her portrayal as Virginia Chance in ''[[Raising Hope]]'' and submitted the episode &quot;Say Cheese&quot; on her behalf.

Plimpton performed &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot; during the [[seventh inning stretch]] of Game 3 of the [[2010 World Series]] in Texas on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]], October 30, 2010.

On December 15, 2010, Chicago's [[Steppenwolf Theatre]] announced that Plimpton will be the guest of honor at their second-annual &quot;Salute to Women in the Arts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreinchicago.com/newswire.php?newsID=317 |title=Theatre in Chicago website |publisher=Theatreinchicago.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, starred in [[Ed Gass-Donnelly]]'s independent, the crime thriller ''[[Small Town Murder Songs]]'', and was given the trophy for best actress by the [[Whistler Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canadian-thriller-whistleblower-wins-borsos-56518 | title=Small Town Murder Songs |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first=Etan | last=Vlessing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:River Phoenix and Martha Plimpton.jpg|thumb|300px|[[River Phoenix]] and Martha Plimpton on the red carpet at the [[61st Academy Awards]], 1989]]

Plimpton is a member of the [[Carradine family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000588/bio&lt;/ref&gt;

Plimpton's high-profile relationship with [[River Phoenix]], including their appearance together at the Academy Awards, overshadowed her work. The relationship ended due to her objection to Phoenix's [[recreational drug use]], from which he died in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Martha-Plimpton/biography/ |title=Martha Plimpton Biography |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plimpton was engaged to stage actor [[Jon Patrick Walker]] in March 1995. The couple were planning to wed in April 1996, according to Plimpton's spokeswomen. Shortly thereafter, however, the couple announced they would not be proceeding with their nuptials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296443,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Jessica | last=Shaw | title=MONITOR – EW.com | date=March 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film career ==
Scheider's first film role was in the 1963 horror film ''[[The Curse of the Living Corpse]]''. (He was billed as &quot;Roy R. Scheider&quot;). In 1971, he appeared in two highly popular movies, ''[[Klute]]'' and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''; the latter, in which he played a fictionalized version of New York City detective [[Sonny Grosso]], gained him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. His first starring role came in 1973 in ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'', a quasi-follow-up to ''The French Connection'', in which Scheider's character is once again based on Grosso.

Two years later, he portrayed Chief Martin Brody in the Hollywood blockbuster ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' which also starred [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. Scheider's famous movie line, &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot;, ad-libbed by Scheider,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7238427.stm|title=Obituary: Roy Scheider|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-11|publisher=''[[BBC]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; was voted 35th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|list of best movie quotes]].

In 1976, he appeared as secret agent Doc Levy in ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', with [[Dustin Hoffman]] (as his younger brother) and [[Laurence Olivier]]. Scheider reunited with ''French Connection'' director [[William Friedkin]] in the box-office flop ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', a remake of the 1953 French film ''[[The Wages of Fear|Le Salaire de la peur (The Wages of Fear)]]''.

He was originally cast as Steven ([[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]'s role) in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', the second movie of a three-movie deal with [[Universal Studios]]. However, despite being under contract, Scheider dropped out two weeks before the start of filming. Universal offered him the option of reprising his role as Martin Brody for a ''Jaws'' sequel, and would consider his contractual obligations fulfilled if he accepted. Scheider accepted, and ''[[Jaws 2]]'' was released in 1978, though it was not a happy production for Scheider, who came into conflict with the film's director [[Jeannot Szwarc]].

In 1979, he received his second Academy Award nomination, this time as [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', in which he played a fictionalized version of the film's director and co-writer [[Bob Fosse]].

In 1983, he starred in ''[[Blue Thunder]]'', a [[John Badham]] film about a fictitious technologically advanced prototype [[attack helicopter]] which provided security over the city of [[Los Angeles]] during the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. This was followed by a role as Dr. Heywood Floyd in [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', a 1984 sequel to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 [[science fiction]] classic ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', in which [[William Sylvester]] originated the role of Floyd.

One of his later parts was that of [[Dr. Benway]] in the long-in-production 1991 film adaptation of [[William S. Burroughs]]' novel ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]''. In 1990 he co-starred with [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[The Russia House]]'' as the smart-talking CIA liaison with [[MI6]]. Scheider played a mob boss in the [[Gary Oldman]] crime film ''[[Romeo Is Bleeding]]'' (1994) and a chief executive of a corrupt insurance company cross-examined by [[Matt Damon]] in 1997's ''[[John Grisham's The Rainmaker]]'', directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

Among his later films, he appeared as the crusty father of hero Frank Castle in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'' (2004), and in 2007, starred in ''[[The Poet (film)|The Poet]]'' and ''If I Didn't Care''. When Scheider died in February 2008, he had two movies upcoming: ''[[Dark Honeymoon]]'', which had been completed, and the thriller ''[[Iron Cross (film)|Iron Cross]]''. In ''Iron Cross'', Scheider plays the leading role of Joseph, a holocaust survivor with a propensity for justice, which was inspired by director Joshua Newton’s late father Bruno Newton. ''Iron Cross'' was ultimately released in 2011.

== Other work ==
Scheider was lead star in the [[Steven Spielberg]]-produced television series ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]'' as [[Nathan Bridger|Captain Nathan Bridger]]. During the second season, Scheider voiced disdain for the direction in which the series was heading. His comments were highly publicized, and the media criticized him for panning his own show. NBC made additional casting and writing changes in the third season, and Scheider decided to leave the show. His contract, however, required that he make several guest appearances that season. He also repeatedly guest-starred on the NBC television series ''[[Third Watch]]'' as fictional character Fyodor Chevchenko.

Scheider hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the tenth (1984–1985) season and appeared on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode &quot;[[Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey]]&quot;, voicing himself as the host of a toilet-training video; portions of which were censored on FOX and syndicated broadcast. Scheider provided voiceover on the ''Family Guy'' episode &quot;[[Three Kings (Family Guy)|Three Kings]]&quot; (which was recorded in September 2007 but aired in May 2009, a year and three months after his death in February 2008) which also featured his ''Jaws'' co-star [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. Scheider guest-starred in the ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' episode &quot;[[Endgame (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|Endgame]]&quot; as [[serial killer]] Mark Ford Brady, who is identified at the episode's end as being the biological father of series star [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s, character, Detective Goren.

Scheider narrated and was associate producer of the 2006 ''Jaws'' documentary ''[[The Shark is Still Working]]''.

In 2007, Scheider received one of two annually-presented Lifetime Achievement Awards at the SunDeis [[Film Festival]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

== Personal life ==
Scheider's first marriage was to Cynthia Bebout on November 8, 1962. The couple had one daughter, Maximillia, before divorcing in 1989. On February 11, 1989, he married actress Brenda King, with whom he had a son, Christian, and adopted a daughter, Molly. They remained married until his death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

== Death ==
In 2004, Scheider was found to have [[multiple myeloma]], and he received a [[bone marrow]] transplant to treat the [[cancer]] in June 2005. He died on February 10, 2008, in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Hospital.

'''Charles Braun Ludlam''' (April 12, 1943 – May 28, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] actor, director, and playwright.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ludlam was born in [[Floral Park, New York]], the son of Marjorie ([[married and maiden names|née]] Braun) and Joseph William Ludlam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/books/chapters/0216-1st-kaufm.html?ex=1205985600&amp;en=213bc8e77867ad22&amp;ei=5070 'Ridiculous!'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Charles-Ludlam.html Charles Ludlam Biography (1943-1987)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Greenlawn, New York]], on Long Island, and attended [[Harborfields High School]]. The fact that he was gay was not a secret. He performed locally in plays with the Township Theater Group, Huntington's community theater, and worked backstage at the Red Barn Theater, a summer stock company in Northport.  While he was in his senior year of high school, he directed, produced and performed with a group of friends, students from Huntington, Northport, Greenlawn, and Centerport. Their &quot;Students Repertory Theatre&quot; in the loft studio beneath the Posey School of Dance on Northport's Main Street was large enough to seat an audience of 25; their audiences were appreciative and enthusiastic, and the house was sold out for every performance. Their repertoire included Madman on the Roof by [[Kan Kikuchi]], Theatre of the Soul [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14045017M/The_theatre_of_the_soul], their own Readers' Theater adaptation of [[Spoon River Anthology]] by [[Edgar Lee Masters]], as well as plays by [[August Strindberg]] and [[Eugene O'Neill]]. He received a degree in dramatic literature from [[Hofstra University]] in 1964, by which time he had officially come out.

===Career===
Ludlam joined [[John Vaccaro]]'s [[Play-House of the Ridiculous]], and after a falling out, became founder of the [[Ridiculous Theatrical Company]] in [[New York City]] in 1967. His first plays were inchoate exercises: however, starting with ''Bluebeard'' he began to write more structured works, which, though they were pastiches of gothic novels, [[Frederico Garcia Lorca|Lorca]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], popular culture, old movies, and anything else that might get a laugh, had more serious import. Theater critic [[Brendan Gill]] after seeing one of Ludlam's plays famously remarked, &quot;This isn't farce. This isn't absurd. This is absolutely ridiculous!&quot;.  Yet on his own work Ludlam had commented: &lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that my work falls into the classical tradition of comedy. Over the years there have been certain traditional approaches to comedy. As a modern artist you have to advance the tradition. I want to work within the tradition so that I don’t waste my time trying to establish new conventions. You can be very original within the established conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Castle, Ted [http://bombsite.com/issues/2/articles/56 &quot;Charles Ludlam and Christopher Scott Interview&quot;] ''BOMB Magazine'', Winter 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ludlam usually appeared in his plays (particularly noted for his female roles), and had written one of the first plays to deal (though tangentially) with [[HIV]] infection. He taught or staged productions at [[New York University]], [[Connecticut College|Connecticut College for Women]], [[Yale University]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He won fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[Ford Foundation]]s and grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]]. He won six [[Obie Award]]s, the last one 2 weeks before his death, and won the [[Rosamund Gilder Award]] for distinguished achievement in the theater in 1986. His most popular play, and the only one to enter the standard repertory, is ''[[The Mystery of Irma Vep]]'', in which two actors manage, through a variety of quick-change techniques, to play seven roles in a send-up of gothic horror novels. The original production featuring Ludlam and his lover [[Everett Quinton]] was a ''tour de force''. In order to ensure [[cross-dressing]], rights to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex. In 1991, Irma Vep was the most produced play in the United States; and in 2003, it became the longest-running play ever produced in [[Brazil]].

Ludlam was diagnosed with [[AIDS]] in March 1987. He attempted to fight the disease by putting his lifelong interest in health foods and macrobiotic diet to use. He died a month later of [[PCP pneumonia]] in [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital, New York]]. The street in front of his theatre in Sheridan Square was renamed &quot;Charles Ludlam Lane&quot; in his honor. 

In 2009, Ludlam was inducted posthumously into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136195-Redgrave-Schwartz-Lloyd-Webber-and-More-Inducted-Into-Theater-Hall-of-Fame-Jan-25 Playbill.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, &quot;Walter Ego&quot;, the ironically named dummy character from Ludlam's play &quot;[[The Ventriloquist's Wife]]&quot;   was donated to the [[Vent Haven Museum]] in [[Fort Mitchell, Kentucky]], where it remains on exhibit today; the puppet was designed and built by actor and noted puppetmaker Alan Semok.

'''Dario Fo''' (born 24 March 1926) is an Italian actor-playwright, theatre director, stage designer, songwriter and political campaigner, and recipient of the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-3/&gt; &quot;Arguably the most widely performed contemporary playwright in world theatre&quot;,&lt;ref name=mitchell-xiii/&gt; much of his dramatic work depends on improvisation and comprises the recovery of &quot;illegitimate&quot; forms of theatre, such as those performed by [[giullari]] (medieval strolling players)&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and, more famously, the ancient Italian style of [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-91-92/&gt;

His plays have been translated into 30 languages and performed across the world, including in Argentina, Chile, England, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=mitchell-65/&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell-101/&gt; His work of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is peppered with criticisms of assassinations, corruption, organised crime, racism, [[Roman Catholic theology]] and war. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he took to lampooning [[Forza Italia]] and its leader [[Silvio Berlusconi]], while his targets of the 2010s have included the banks amid the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].

Fo's solo ''pièce célèbre'', titled ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' and performed across Europe, Canada and Latin America over a 30-year period, is recognised as one of the most controversial and popular spectacles in postwar European theatre and has been denounced by the Vatican as &quot;the most blasphemous show in the history of television&quot;.&lt;ref name=mitchell-3&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the original English translation of ''Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!'' (''[[Can't Pay? Won't Pay!]]'') has passed into the English language.&lt;ref name=lyn_gardner_guardian_pay/&gt;

His receipt of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature marked the &quot;international acknowledgment of Fo as a major figure in twentieth-century world theatre&quot;.&lt;ref name=mitchell-xiv/&gt; The [[Swedish Academy]] praised Fo as a writer &quot;who emulates the [[jester]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobelprize/&gt; He currently owns and operates a theatre company with his wife, actress [[Franca Rame]], with whom he lives in [[Milan]].

==Early life and education==
An eldest child, Fo was born at [[Leggiuno]] [[Sangiano]], in [[Lombardy]]'s [[Province of Varese]], near the eastern shore of [[Lake Maggiore|Lago Maggiore]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-47/&gt; His younger brother Fulvio would become a theatre administrator, their younger sister Bianca Fo Garambois, a writer.&lt;ref name=mitchell-47/&gt; Their mother, Pina Rota Fo, from a peasant background, wrote a book of reminiscences of the area between the wars, ''Il paese delle rane'' (''Land of Frogs'', 1978).&lt;ref name=mitchell-47/&gt; Their father, Felice, was a [[station master]] for the Italian state railway, and the family frequently moved along the Swiss border when Felice was transferred to new postings.&lt;ref name=mitchell-47/&gt; Felice, a [[Italian Socialist Party|socialist]], was also an actor, appearing for an amateur theatre company in works by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] among others.&lt;ref name=mitchell-47&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Fo learned storytelling from his maternal grandfather and Lombard fishers and [[Glassblowing|glassblower]]s. Among the places in which Fo lived during his early years was [[Porto Valtravaglia]], a glassblowing colony in which, it has been claimed, resided the highest percentage of insane people in Italy.&lt;ref name=mitchell-49&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 49; Mitchell's book spells it &quot;Portoaltravaglia&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Fo moved to [[Milan]] to study at the [[Brera Academy]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-49/&gt; However, the [[World War II|Second World War]] intervened. Fo's family was active in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]]; Fo helped his father to smuggle refugees and Allied soldiers to Switzerland by disguising them as Lombard peasants.&lt;ref name=mitchell-49/&gt; His father is also thought to have helped smuggle Jewish scientists to the safety of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Duval Smith|title=A Nobel Calling: 100 Years of Controversy|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=14 October 2005|quote=1997: As a young man, the author of ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist'' was conscripted into Mussolini's army towards the end of the war, but escaped and hid in an attic ... His father played a key role in the Resistance during the Second World War, smuggling Jewish scientists into Switzerland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the end of the war approached, Fo joined the anti-aircraft division of the navy, anticipating an immediate discharge due to a shortage of munitions. He was mistaken and was instead dispatched to a camp in [[Monza]] at which [[Benito Mussolini]] himself arrived. Fo soon deserted with the aid of false documents and wandered for a while before joining a parachute squadron. He then deserted this as well, prompting a further unsuccessful search for the Resistance movement during which he slept rough in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Fo returned to the Brera Academy, also taking up architectural studies at the [[Politecnico di Milano]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-50/&gt; He started a thesis on Roman architecture, but becoming disillusioned by the cheap impersonal work expected of architects after the war, he left his studies before his final examinations.&lt;ref name=mitchell-50/&gt; He had a nervous breakdown; a doctor told him to spend time doing that which brought him joy.&lt;ref name=mitchell-50&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He began to paint and became involved in the ''piccoli teatri'' (small theatres) movement, in which he began to present improvised [[monologue]]s.

==Career==
===1950s===
In 1950, Fo asked to work with [[Franco Parenti]] on a variety show performed by radio actors, beginning a collaboration that would last until 1954. Fo delighted audiences with stories of his upbringing that Parenti was very impressed by, describing them as &quot;absolutely original, with an extraordinary humour, wit and personification. When the show was over we'd go for walks round the lake and he'd tell me more stories. In this way we originated a project in which we would work together on a new type of revue, one which didn't copy reality, but which involved people and took a stand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1951, after Fo had gained experience with Parenti, Italian national radio station [[RAI]] invited Fo to perform a solo Saturday evening comedy series ''Poer nano'' (Poor dwarf), airing after Parenti's ''Anacleto the Gas Man''. Fo created 18 adult fairy tale monologues adapted from biblical and historical tales. The series also featured Shakespearean tales with various twists, such as a version of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which [[Prince Hamlet|the titular character]] kills his father to continue an affair with [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|his mother]]; [[Ophelia]] is portrayed as [[King Claudius|Hamlet's uncle]]'s transvestite mistress, while [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]] plays [[Ghost (Hamlet)|the ghost of Hamlet's father]] dressed up as a sheet and only appears when Hamlet is drunk. The series also featured an [[Albinism|albino]] [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and a sadistic [[Juliet]] who keeps [[Romeo]] in her garden with savage dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Scandalised authorities cancelled the show. Nevertheless, Fo performed it on stage at the [[Teatro Odeon]] in Milan in 1952, which allowed him to develop the gesture and action not required for radio.&lt;ref name=mitchell-54&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1952, Fo performed ''Cocoricò'' with [[Giustino Durano]], which featured a 20-minute sketch focusing on the plight of [[Jim Crow laws|black people in the United States]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-54/&gt;

In 1953, Fo&amp;mdash;in collaboration with Parenti and Durano in their own revue company which they called I Dritti (The Stand-ups)&amp;mdash;co-wrote, co-directed and designed the sets and costumes for a revue called ''Il dito nell'occhio'' (''A finger in the eye'').&lt;ref name=mitchell-55&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The title referred to that of a column in the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) newspaper ''[[l'Unità]]''.&lt;ref name=mitchell-56/&gt; ''Il dito nell'occhio'' consisted of 21 sketches similar in style to ''Poer nano'' but dealing instead with a satirical history of the world.&lt;ref name=mitchell-56/&gt; The last performance in which Fo played a supporting role, it was a box-office success and went on tour after 113 performances at Milan's [[Piccolo Teatro (Milan)|Piccolo Teatro]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-56/&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell-57&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 1953 also brought the beginning of Fo's songwriting. He collaborated with [[Fiorenzo Carpi]]; all of Fo's plays as far as 1967 would feature Carpi's music. &quot;La luna è una lampadina&quot; (&quot;The moon is a lightbulb&quot;), their first song, is one of Fo's most famous.&lt;ref name=mitchell-57/&gt;

Fo met [[Franca Rame]], daughter of a theatrical family, when they were working in the revue ''Sette giorni a Milano''. They became engaged, and he married her on 24 June 1954. They had a son, Jacopo (born 31 March 1955), who would also become a writer.&lt;ref name=mitchell-55/&gt;

With the break-up of I dritti due to financial failure, Fo and family moved to [[Rome]] in the hope of gaining work as a screenwriter in the cinema.&lt;ref name=mitchell-59&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; There they lived next door to [[Roberto Rossellini]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-59/&gt; Fo worked for many productions, including those of [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. Rame worked in Teatro Stabile of Bolzano. In 1956, Fo co-wrote and acted with Rame in the [[Carlo Lizzani]]'s film ''Lo svitato'' (''The screwball''), influenced by [[Jacques Tati]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the film, Fo plays &quot;a disoriented hotel porter cast adrift in a neo-capitalist Milan of skyscrapers and modern technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Other films followed. In 1958, the couple returned to Milan when Rame was offered roles in a series of farces at the Arlecchino Theatre.&lt;ref name=mitchell-60/&gt; Fo and Rame have been based there ever since.&lt;ref name=mitchell-60&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Fo said, &quot;For me the lesson of the cinema meant learning from a technical point of view what audiences had already grasped: a story divided into sequences, a fast pace, sharp dialogue, and getting rid of the conventions of space and time. Working on screenplays gave me an apprenticeship as a playwright and I was able to transfer the lessons of the new technical means to the theatre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the Compagnia Fo-Rame dates from this time. Fo wrote scripts, acted, directed, and designed costumes and stage paraphernalia. Rame took care of the administration. The company débuted at the Piccolo Teatro, and in 1959 began a series of six full-length plays that were performed each season at the Teatro Odeon.&lt;ref name=mitchell-65/&gt; One of these, ''Gli arcangeli non giocano al flipper'' (''[[Archangels Don't Play Pinball]]''), brought Fo and Rame national and, later, international recognition. It would be the first Fo play to be performed outside Italy&amp;mdash;in [[Yugoslavia]], [[Poland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-65&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Other successes would follow.

===1960s===
In 1962, Fo wrote and directed a variety show, ''Canzonissima'', for RAI. Fo used the show to give Italians a glimpse of a type of television resembling the origins of theatre, one far removed from the diversionary and trivial dross which until then had been churned out by one of the world's leading producers of &quot;junk TV&quot;.&lt;ref name=mitchell-73/&gt; ''Canzonissima'' featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes. However, it was regularly censored. One sketch featured a fat aunt who came to visit her nephew at his workplace (a canned meat factory) only to fall into a machine and come out as mincemeat, which the nephew retained in a cupboard at home and often displayed to friends: this led to complaints from canned meat producers and &quot;industrialists in general&quot;&amp;mdash;though none from aunts, Fo later observed.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless ''Canzonissima'' proved popular, attracting millions of viewers, and Rame maintained that taxi drivers in Italian cities would often say they had no work during broadcasts as everyone was watching it.&lt;ref name=mitchell-73&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Its eighth episode&amp;mdash;which referenced the dangerous conditions faced by workers on building sites&amp;mdash;led to a dispute with the programme's producers, and prompted Fo and Rame to walk out on 29 November 1962. RAI maintained it would not broadcast the sketch as it risked further inflaming the annoyance of building workers' unions at working conditions. National uproar ensued over this censorship, with headlines in the daily newspapers and questions in the Italian parliament. RAI sued Fo and Rame and destroyed all the ''Canzonissima'' recordings. The dispute led to the effective banning of Fo and Rame from Italian television for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Fo returned to Milan's Teatro Odeon with the play ''Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciballe'' (''[[Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man]]''), considered &quot;an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image&quot; of [[Christopher Columbus]]. Fo said: &quot;I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats on a piece of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, play games with the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by [[Fascism|fascist]] groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He recounted this event in the prologue of ''[[Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas]]''.

''La signora è da buttare'' (''[[Throw the Lady Out]]'') was the final play Fo put on in the mainstream, establishment Italian theatre.&lt;ref name=mitchell-85/&gt; Performed in 1967, it contained topical references to the [[Vietnam War]], [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], and the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. The play prompted the first English-language piece of criticism on Fo's work by U.S. critic A. Richard Sogliuzzo in 1972.&lt;ref name=mitchell-85&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the titular lady as &quot;representing American capitalism [... and who just before her death] was elevated above a sink in a [[Statue of Liberty]] pose, and then ascended to a heaven packed with consumer goods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] would later consistently deny Fo entry under the now-defunct [[McCarran-Walter Act]].

Inspired by the events of [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968 in France]], Fo and Rame abandoned the official state theatre in Italy and set up Associazione Nuova Scena, a theatre collective operating outside the state structure.&lt;ref name=mitchell-89&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; They asked the PCI for assistance and access to community centres and workers' clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1968, they toured Fo's latest play ''Grande pantomima con bandiere e pupazzi piccoli i medi'' (''[[Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Middle-sized Puppets]]''), opening in [[Cesena]]. The play, which featured masks instead of characters&amp;mdash;representing Capital, the Confederation of Industry, High Finance, the Church, the People, Rebels and Peasants&amp;mdash;,included a giant puppet representing fascism which gave birth to representatives of the Church, the Monarchy, the Army and Industrialism.&lt;ref name=mitchell-91-92&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'operaio conosce 300 parole, il padrone 1,000: per questo lui è il padrone'' (''[[The Worker Knows 300 Words, the Boss Knows 1000, That's Why He's the Boss]]''), ''Legame pure che tanto io spacco tutto lo stesso'' (''[[Chain Me Up and I'll Still Smash Everything]]''), and ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' (''Comical Mystery'') also date from this time.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Though Fo himself had never been a Communist Party member,&lt;ref name=mitchell-89/&gt; his open criticism of PCI methods and policies on the stage led to conflict with the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. pp. 95–98&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In 1970, Fo and Rame began their third theatre group, ''Collettivo Teatrale &quot;La Comune&quot;'' with the musician Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi.&lt;ref name=mitchell-99&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (''capannone'') in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting it into a sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was ''Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non è servito a niente'' (''[[I'd Rather Die Tonight If I Had To Think It Had All Been In Vain]]''). Inspired by the [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]], with the title derived from a [[Renata Viganò]] poem, thousands of people came to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was ''Morte accidentale di un anarchico'' (''[[Accidental Death of an Anarchist]]''), Fo's most internationally recognised play, described by the playwright as &quot;a grotesque farce about a tragic farce&quot;.&lt;ref name=mitchell-101&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in December 1970,&lt;ref name=mitchell-101/&gt; Fo having written it after right-wing extremists and the Italian Secret Service carried out a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack on the [[Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura]] in [[Piazza Fontana]] in Milan in 1969.&lt;ref name=mitchell-99/&gt;  (See: [[Strategy of tension]].) This farce subsequently toured Italy with ''Tutti uniti! Tutti insieme! Ma scusa, quello non è il padrone?'' (''[[United We Stand! All Together Now! Oops, Isn't That the Boss?]]''), considered by Rame to be Fo's best work apart from ''Morte accidentale'' and ''Mistero buffo''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morte e resurezione di un pupazzo'' (''[[Death and Resurrection of a Puppet]]'') was an updated version of ''Grande pantomima''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fedayn]]'', first performed in January 1972, comprised a series of autobiographical accounts from [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1973, fascists commissioned by high-ranking officials in Milan's [[Carabinieri]] (Italian federal police) abducted Rame, held her at gunpoint and dumped her in a van. They raped her, beat her, burnt her with cigarettes, slashed her with razor blades and left her in a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Beret|last=Kuennecke|url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=7952|title=Resistance Takes Centre Stage|work=Review|date=April 2002}} Review of 'Harlequins of the Revolution', Joseph Farrell, Methuen, which mentions the rape.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; A split in ''La Comune'' reduced their ranks; nevertheless, Fo and Rame continued to tour around Lombardy and [[Veneto]] throughout that year, the short piece ''[[Mamma Togni]]'' dating from this time.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1973, following the assassination of [[Salvador Allende]] in [[Chile]], ''Guerra di popolo in Cile'' (''[[The People's War in Chile]]'') came to be. It toured the country amassing great interest, particularly due to a part at the end which unnerved audiences who thought a coup had been declared across Italy. According to Chiara Valentini, a member of the audience panicked during a performance in [[Turin]] and ate ten pages of what he thought might be compromising names, while in [[Merano]] a student broke the glass in an attempt to flee through a window.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; The real police arrested Fo in [[Sassari]] in November 1973, leading to nationwide uproar when it emerged that under Italian law the police could not enter the theatre during the performance; the outcry served only to boost attendances at future performances.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Salvador Allende 2.jpg|160|Amintore Fanfani.JPG|130|Left: [[Salvador Allende]]; Right: [[Amintore Fanfani]]}}
In 1974, the company&amp;mdash;which had now become ''Il Collettivo Teatrale &quot;La Comune&quot; diretto da Dario Fo''&amp;mdash;occupied and cleaned up an abandoned market building in [[Porta Vittoria]] (a working-class area of Milan) and dubbed it the Palazzina Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Political enmities intervened however, and Milan's council tried to remove them by court order. The council was unsuccessful; the company was allowed to stay temporarily and set about developing facilities such as a library, conference centre, theatre and audiovisual workshops. They began performing with ''Porta e Belli contro il potere'' (''[[Porta and Belli Against the Authorities]]''), in which Fo read sonnets by the two titular 19th-century poets, described by him as &quot;splendid texts, and when I recited them individually they worked marvellously, but not altogether in the same show.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Soon followed the farce, ''Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!'' (''[[Can't Pay? Won't Pay!]]''), documenting the ''autoriduzione'' (self-reduction) movement which had developed during the severe economic crisis Italy was experiencing, and in which women (and men) would take what they wished from markets, only paying for what they could afford. Regarded as Fo's best-known play internationally after ''Morte accidentale di un anarchico'', it had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''Can't Pay? Won't Pay!'' has also passed into the English language.&lt;ref name=lyn_gardner_guardian_pay&gt;{{cite news|first=Lyn|last=Gardner|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/apr/18/low-pay-dont-pay-review|title=Low Pay? Don't Pay!|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the backdrop of the [[Italian regional elections, 1975|June 1975 Italian elections]], Fo wrote ''Il Fanfani rapito'' (''[[Fanfani Kidnapped]]'')&amp;mdash;a reference to [[Amintore Fanfani]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame and other members of the company went to China&amp;mdash;Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue ''La storia della tigre'' (''[[The Tale of a Tiger]]''), with which he toured around Italy in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell-157/&gt; The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]] for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: &quot;I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. I can imagine the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians I know. They take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick like this ... [Receiving the prize] would be like acting in one of my plays.&quot;&lt;ref name=mitchell-xiv&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Fo next turned to Italy's growing drug problem, summing it up as follows: &quot;Rich people consume and use drugs, while poor people are used and consumed by drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; ''La marijuana della mamma è la più bella'' (''[[Mother's Marijuana is the Best]]'') features a character called Grandpa who mistakenly swallows [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] instead of [[aspirin]] and hallucinates a farcical tram journey in his wardrobe ending at a police station.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorenzo Carpi returned to collaborate with Fo on the play's music, the first time they had worked together since 1967.&lt;ref name=mitchell-146&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Fo returned to television in 1977 after 14 years off the air, RAI's administration having been changed following the [[Italian general election, 1976|previous year's general election]]. Fo was, however, limited to [[Rai 2]], the second channel, which had a more socialist and non-religious slant than the more conservative [[Rai 1]]. Two cycles of his plays were broadcast; for political reasons these did not include ''Morte accidentale di un anarchico'', ''Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!'' or ''Il Fanfani rapito'' (though La Commune filmed them anyway to have a permanent record of them).&lt;ref name=mitchell-146/&gt; Even so, the Vatican still denounced ''Mistero buffo'' as &quot;the most blasphemous show in the history of television&quot;.&lt;ref name=mitchell-3/&gt; A new play for the TV series, ''Parliamo di donne'' (''[[Let's Talk About Women]]''), focused on topics such as [[abortion]], [[sexism]] and the [[Holy Family]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of five monologues collectively titled ''Tutta casa, letto e chiesa'' (''[[All House, Bed and Church]]'') also first appeared in 1977, and were performed by Rame. [1] ''Il risveglio'' (''[[Waking Up (play)|Waking Up]]'') featured a working class mother talking to her baby (a doll). [2] ''Una donna tutta sola'' (''[[A Woman Alone (play)|A Woman Alone]]'') was about a housewife locked indoors by her husband who must deal with a crying baby while fighting off the advances of his crippled wheelchair-bound pornographic film-obsessed brother, a man with a telescope, an obscene telephone caller and a former teacher who has fallen in love with her.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; [3] ''La mamma fricchettona'' (''[[Freak Mother]]'') featured a mother taking shelter in a church confessional after leaving her family to pursue drugs and [[free love]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; [4] ''[[The Same Old Story (play)|The Same Old Story]]'' features a little girl with a doll who swears.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; [5] ''[[Medea (Fo play)|Medea]]'', based on an Italian version rather than the more famous [[Euripides]] version, had been performed in 35 countries by 1990&amp;mdash;though it annoyed some English feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In 1980, United States authorities blocked Fo and Rame from performing at the country's Festival of Italian Theatre, with their banishment from the country compared to the country's similar treatment of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-162/&gt; In May that year, &quot;An Evening Without Dario Fo and Franca Rame&quot;, held in New York, was attended by offended persons, among whom were [[Arthur Miller]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Martin Scorsese]]. The event featured a reading in English of the first act of ''Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!'' and a letter (read by Piero Sciotto) written by Fo and Rame.&lt;ref name=mitchell-162&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Critics' Association]] sent a letter to [[Edmund Muskie]], an important politician.&lt;ref name=mitchell-162/&gt;

However, in September 1983, U.S. authorities again refused them permission to enter, and, to Fo's bewilderment, accused them of &quot;belonging to organisations supporting terrorist groups.&quot;&lt;ref name=mitchell-162/&gt; At this time Fo was the foreign writer whose plays were most widely produced in that country.&lt;ref name=mitchell-162/&gt; [[Joseph Papp]] sent a telegram to the country's president&amp;mdash;retired actor [[Ronald Reagan]]&amp;mdash;to no avail. Fo and Rame began a lawsuit against the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], pledging any damages received to sacked workers and occupied workplaces, the disabled, families of prisoners and other causes of which they were fond. Fo called a press conference in Milan to explain the grave offence U.S. authorities had caused himself and his wife: &quot;We are Italian citizens who are supposed to have committed the crime of aiding and abetting terrorists in Italy. The Italian judicial authorities, however have never charged us or even made inquiries [...] nor have they accused us of any support of terrorism: in any case our position on the subject is well known. Now the Americans arrive on the scene and decide that we support terrorists, which means either that the Italian judicial authorities aren't doing their job or that they are in complicity with us.&quot;&lt;ref name=mitchell-163/&gt;

In 1981, with La Commune having been evicted from the Palazzina Liberty, a second version of ''Tutta casa, letto e chiesa'' opened at the Teatro Odeon, the first time in 16 years that Fo and Rame performed there.&lt;ref name=mitchell-157&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year (January) ''Clacson, trombette e pernacchi'' (''[[Trumpets and Raspberries]]'') was first performed at Milan's Cinema Cristallo, and was Fo's first new play since ''La marijuana della mamma è la più bella'' five years previously.&lt;ref name=mitchell-163&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; 50,000 people saw it performed 34 times in Milan, and it had soon been produced in 15 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Italian censors restricted ''Coppia aperta, quasi spalancata'' (''[[The Open Couple]]'') to audiences over the age of 18 when Rame included as a prologue her monologue ''The Rape'' (inspired by her own rape).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; ''Il candelaio'' (''The Candlestickmaker''), a monologue written by Fo in 1983, displayed Fo's increased interest in the English Elizabethan Theatre, and preceded ''Quasi per caso una donna: Elisabetta'' (''[[Elizabeth: Almost by Chance a Woman]]''), which Fo and Rame began work on in late 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; 1985 brought ''Hellequin, Harlekin, Arlecchino''&amp;mdash;based on [[Harlequin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; 1986 brought ''[[Kidnapping Francesca]]'', in which bankrupt banker Francesca Bollini de Rill has herself kidnapped to divert from her imminent arrest&amp;mdash;adapted as ''Abducting Diana'' in 1994 by [[Stephen Stenning]] for English audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 192–194&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed Professor of Drama at the University of Rome, Fo's seminars there included Harlequin and the ''commedia dell'arte''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Christmas 1987 performance of ''[[The First Miracle of the Infant Jesus]]'' on Italian television's variety-lottery show ''Fantastico'' led to further accusations of blasphemy from the Vatican; Fo portrayed the titular character deploying bolts of lightning to save other children from a bully.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in 26 years, in April and May 1988, Fo and Rame collaborated on an original project, ''Transmissione forzata'' (''Forced Transmission'') on Italian television. Restricted to [[Rai 3]], the series featured ironic songs about RAI censorship and Italian politicians, dancing girls and satirical news bulletins, a ballet on Palestine and a &quot;weather report&quot; on national rape statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1988, Fo returned to film acting for the first time since 1958, playing a retired professor in ''Musica per vecchi animali'' (''Music for Old Animals'').&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, in solidarity with those affected by the [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]], Fo updated ''La storia della tigre'' and wrote two monologues ''Lettera dalla Cina'' (''[[Letter from China]]'') and ''[[The Story of Qu]]''. The same year, Fo also wrote ''Il ricercato'' (''[[The Wanted Man]]''), an unperformed play about the mafia, and ''Il Papa e la strega'' (''[[The Pope and the Witch]]''), which debuted in late October.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The latter portrayed a Pope overcome both by a phobia of being attacked by children and by an attack of arthritis which leaves his arms raised in blessing, and who, acting upon the advice of a woman disguised as a nun and claiming to be a witch, swings from a chandelier and injects himself with heroin during his search for a cure, and avoids various assassination attempts involving a toy car, poisoned parrot and Brazilian nun.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Critics praised its comic inventiveness and it won an award for being the play seen by most people in Italy that season.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Addressing themes such as [[AIDS]], the [[Gulf War]] and [[Genetic engineering|genetic experiment]]s, Fo wrote ''Zitti! Stiamo precipitando!'' (''[[Hush! We're Falling!]]'') in summer 1990, and it debuted at Milan's Teatro Nuovo that November.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The titular character of ''[[Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas]]'', Fo's response to the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, is a Venetian fugitive who escapes from the [[Spanish Inquisition]] by joining the explorer and coloniser's fourth voyage. Forced to tend the animals on board, a storm casts him adrift in the ocean on the back of a pig until he reaches the coast and is rescued by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; A video recording of Fo's performance exists.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; 1993 brought an important anniversary of [[Carlo Goldoni]]; Fo, who was unimpressed, and, choosing instead to focus his attention on [[Angelo Beolco]], planned a joint production between his company and Teatro dei Incamminati, a publicly funded company. However, with rehearsals well underway, a ministerial letter arrived to block the project's completion with &quot;an obscure law forbidding co-productions between public and private companies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

Fo and Rame collaborated on the monologue ''Settimo: ruba un po' meno no. 2'' (''[[Seventh Commandment: Steal a Bit Less No. 2]]''), inspired by the corruption scandals ([[Tangentopoli]]) which were rife in Italy during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; They later performed ''Mamma! I sanculotti!'' (''[[Mummy! The Sans-culottes!]]''), set in the eighteenth century but also making references to the Tangentopoli, and featuring music again by Fiorenzo Carpi.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1994 monologue ''Sesso? Grazie, tanto per gradire!'' (''[[Sex? Thanks, Don't Mind If I Do!]]''), Fo and Rame worked with their Jacopo to produce a performance based on Jacopo's 1992 book ''Lo Zen e l'arte di scopare'' (''[[Zen and the Art of Fucking]]''), featuring educational pieces on topics such as AIDS, contraception, sex education and sexual repression.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Thus came Fo's first run-in with the new government of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Berlusoni's government banned Italians under the age of 18 from seeing it over fears, it said, that the play could &quot;cause offence to the common decency which requires respect for spheres of decency, and provoke distress among adolescent spectators, with possible effects on their behaviour in relation to sex&quot;, thus defeating the original purpose of the performance. Much free publicity ensued, with the censorship issue being debated in the national parliament, teachers calling for it to be performed, and audiences and both Italian and foreign intellectuals signing a petition calling for the ban to be overturned.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 1995, Fo had a stroke which he quickly recovered from and was well again by his seventieth birthday on 24 March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1996, he wrote ''[[Leonardo: The Flight, the Count and the Amours]]''. Set in 1502, the titular character of the play was [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he wrote ''Il diavolo con le zinne'' (''[[The Devil with Boobs]]''). Described by Fo as &quot;a [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] comedy, a gigantic late sixteenth-century intrigue, with judges and devils, housekeepers possessed by devils, hermits, gendarmes, torturers and even a monkey&quot;, it featured an homage to Fiorenzo Carpi who had died earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 227–229&lt;/ref&gt;

9 October 1997 brought the announcement from Sweden that Fo had been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], becoming both the first Italian to be selected for the award since [[Eugenio Montale]] in 1975 and the first Italian playwright to be chosen since [[Luigi Pirandello]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=gumbel_showman&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Gumbel|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/nobel-prize-dario-fo-the-showman-wins-nobel-literature-prize-1234928.html|title=Nobel Prize: Dario Fo, the showman, wins Nobel literature prize|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=10 October 1997|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Academy]], in its citation, praised him as a writer &quot;who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobelprize&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1997|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo, driving along the Rome-Milan motorway at the time of the announcement, was alerted to the news when a car drew up alongside his with an enormous placard in the window exclaiming &quot;Dario, you've won the Nobel prize!&quot;&lt;ref name=gumbel_showman/&gt; 20-year-old TV star [[Ambra Angiolini]] was alongside him in the car recording an interview, so Fo's initial reaction was captured on film.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement came as a shock to Italians and non-Italians alike. Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who &quot;does not belong to the traditional academic world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt; However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic [[Carlo Bo]] was mystified: &quot;I must be too old to understand. What does this mean? That everything changes, even literature has changed.&quot;&lt;ref name=gumbel_showman/&gt; Fo's fellow Italian laureate [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Luzi]], a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed the phone down on one reporter: &quot;I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!&quot;&lt;ref name=gumbel_showman/&gt; Reaction from the [[Anglosphere]] was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=mitchell-xiii&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. playwright [[Tony Kushner]], however, expressed his approval, writing: &quot;[Fo] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [It] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called ''Contra jogulatores obloquentes'' (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as &quot;undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy.&quot;&lt;ref name=mitchell-xiv/&gt;

In 2004, [[Forza Italia]] senator [[Marcello Dell'Utri]], on trial at the time for money laundering, sued Fo over references to him in his latest play. Fo was disgusted: &quot;I have been doing satire for 40 years. It is paradox. It is grotesque.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sophie|last=Arie|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/14/italy.arts|title=Dario Fo sued for €1m over play lampooning PM: Nobel-winning playwright accused of 'persecution'|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 January 2004|accessdate=14 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play, titled ''The Two-Headed Anomaly'' and first performed in 2003, also poked fun at the shortness of then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, had him strapped to a chair and given electric shock treatment and portrayed [[Vladimir Putin]] being shot dead by Chechen rebels while visiting Berlusconi's luxury villa in [[Sicily]]. The title referred to the subsequent transplanting of Putin's brain into Berlusconi's head, and the play was performed amid debate over Berlusconi's business and political interests and media censorship, with RAI having barred Italian satirists [[Sabina Guzzanti]] and [[Paolo Rossi]] from its television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sophie|last=Arie|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/dec/07/italy.arts|title=Comic Fo exposes Berlusconi's flaws|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 December 2003|accessdate=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo spoke of receiving threats from politicians if he performed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tamsin|last=Smith|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3294693.stm|title=Fo's play gives Berlusconi a roasting|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=5 December 2003|accessdate=5 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Fo revealed plans to run for [[List of mayors of Milan|Mayor of Milan]], the most economically important city in Italy, the following year.

parents.&lt;ref name=NLGBB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tom |last=Tugend |title=In Search of Nathan Lane's 'Jewish' Roots |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?051230+search |work=[[Jewish News of Greater Phoenix]] |publisher=jewishaz.com |volume=58 |issue=14 |date=December 30, 2005 |accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after his uncle, a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Smith |title=Bring on the clown |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1345473,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |date=November 7, 2004 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |publisher=guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Daniel, was a truck driver and an aspiring tenor who died from alcoholism when Lane was eleven; his mother, Nora, was a housewife and secretary who suffered from [[bipolar disorder|manic-depression]], and died in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Bruce |last=Vilanch |title=Citizen Lane – Actor Nathan Lane |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53729227.html |work=[[The Advocate]] |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=February 2, 1999 |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nathan Lane Biography |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018675/bio |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Lane attended Roman Catholic schools in [[Jersey City]], including Jesuit-run [[St. Peter's Preparatory High School]], where he was selected Best Actor in 1974.

==Career==
===1970s–1980s===
His brother Dan accompanied him to what was supposed to be his first day at [[Saint Joseph's University|St. Joseph's College]] in Philadelphia, where he had received a drama scholarship. When they arrived, they learned he still couldn't cover enough of the expenses for him to stay without taking out another student loan, so he decided to go back home. &quot;I remember him saying to me, 'College is for people who don't know what they want to do,'&quot; Dan Lane recalled. Because there already was a Joseph Lane registered with [[Actors Equity]], he changed his name to Nathan after the character [[Nathan Detroit]] from the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''. He moved to [[New York City]] where, after a long struggle, his career began to take off, first with some brief success in the world of stand-up comedy with partner, Patrick Stack, and later with [[Off-Broadway]] productions at [[Second Stage Theatre]], the [[Roundabout Theatre Company|Roundabout Theatre]], the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]], and his 1982 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a revival of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Present Laughter]]'' as Roland Maule ([[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nomination) with  [[George C. Scott]], [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]], [[Dana Ivey]], and [[Christine Lahti]].

His second Broadway appearance was in the 1983 musical ''[[Merlin (musical)|Merlin]]'', starring [[Chita Rivera]] and magician [[Doug Henning]]. This was followed by ''[[Wind in the Willows (musical)|Wind in the Willows]]'' as [[Mr. Toad]], ''Some Americans Abroad'' at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], and the national tour of Neil Simon's ''[[Broadway Bound]]''.

===1990s===
In 1991, Lane starred with George C. Scott again in a revival of Paul Osborne's ''[[On Borrowed Time]]'' at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] on Broadway. In 1992, he starred in the hit revival of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', receiving his first [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination, as well as Drama Desk and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]s, playing the character who lent him his name, opposite [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Faith Prince]].

His professional association with his close friend the [[playwright]] [[Terrence McNally]] includes roles in  ''[[The Lisbon Traviata]]'' (Drama Desk and [[Lucille Lortel]] Awards), ''[[Bad Habits (play)|Bad Habits]]'', ''[[Lips Together, Teeth Apart]]'', ''[[Love! Valour! Compassion!]]'' ([[Obie Award|Obie]], Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards),  ''Dedication or the Stuff of Dreams'' (Drama Desk nomination), The Last Mile on PBS Great Performances, and the film version of [[Frankie and Johnny (1991 film)|Frankie and Johnny]]. The early 1990s began a stretch of successful Broadway shows for Lane.  In 1993, he portrayed [[Sid Caesar]]-like Max Prince in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Laughter on the 23rd Floor]]'', inspired by Simon's early career writing sketches for ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''.  In 1996, he starred in the hit revival of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', for which he won the Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards.

His association with Sondheim began with the workshop of ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', and after ''Forum'' he appeared with [[Victor Garber]] in the workshop of ''Wise Guys'' (later retitled ''[[Road Show (musical)|Road Show]]''). Their collaboration continued when he revised the original book for and starred in the Broadway debut of the composer's ''[[The Frogs (musical)|The Frogs]]'' at Lincoln Center in 2004. He also sang a song written especially for him by Sondheim in the film ''[[The Birdcage]]'', for which he received his first [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

In addition to the McNally plays, Lane has appeared  in numerous other Off Broadway productions, including ''Love'' (the musical version of [[Murray Schisgal]]'s ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]]''), ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' directed by [[Joseph Papp]] in Central Park, for which he received the St. Clair Bayfield Award,  ''The Common Pursuit'', ''The Film Society'', ''Mizlansky/Zilinsky or Schmucks'', ''In a Pig's Valise'', ''Trumbo'', ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. In fact, in 1992 he won an [[Obie Award]] for Sustained Excellence of Performance. He also appeared at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and John Guare's ''Moon Over Miami''.

In 1994, Lane voiced Timon, the meerkat, in Disney's blockbuster animated film The Lion King and in 1995 performed ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert]]'' at Lincoln Center to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT), and issued on CD and video in 1996.

===2000s===
Lane won his second Tony Award for his portrayal of [[Max Bialystock]] in the blockbuster musical version of [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', as well as Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards. He later replaced [[Richard Dreyfuss]] in the role in 2004 at [[London]]'s [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] at the last minute, and went on to win the [[Olivier Award]] as Best Actor in a Musical. He recreated his performance for the film version, for which he received his second [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy.

Lane has performed two roles originated by [[Zero Mostel]], Pseudolus in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' and Max Bialystock in ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''. He declined the role of Tevye in the 2004 Broadway revival of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' because he didn't want to be seen as always following in Mostel's footsteps. Coincidentally, both of Lane's Tony Awards were for Mostel's roles. In 2000, he starred in the Roundabout revival of ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' as Sheridan Whiteside, with [[Jean Smart]] and Harriet Harris. Prior to that he starred in the [[Encores!]] production of ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]''.

In 2005, Lane rejoined his ''Producers'' co-star Matthew Broderick for a successful limited run of ''[[The Odd Couple]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;odd&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Ben Brantley| url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/10/28/theater/reviews/28odd.html| title=Theater Review- ''The Odd Couple''| date=October 28, 2005| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=June 27, 2012| publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he took on a primarily dramatic role in a revival of [[Simon Gray]]'s ''[[Butley (play)|Butley]]'', having played the role to great success at The Huntington Theater in Boston in 2003. He and Broderick were awarded adjacent stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in a joint ceremony on January 9, 2006. They were also immortalized as Max and Leo at [[Madame Tussauds|Madame Tussauds Wax Museum]]. He then played the President of the United States in the [[David Mamet]] political satire, ''[[November (play)|November]]'', directed by [[Joe Mantello]], followed by  the critically acclaimed revival of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' as Estragon (Outer Critics Circle nomination)&lt;ref name=&quot;frey&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Frey |first=Hillary |title=Broadway Bows Down to Power Dames Fonda, Sarandon, Lansbury |url=http://www.observer.com/2009/broadway-bows-down-power-dames-fonda-sarandon-lansbury |work=[[The New York Observer]]|date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |publisher=observer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bill Irwin as Vladimir. He next starred in the musical version of ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]'' as Gomez (Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle nominations).  In 2008, he was inducted into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].

===2010s===
Lane committed to starring in a revival of the [[Eugene O'Neill]] play [[The Iceman Cometh]] at Chicago's [[Goodman Theatre]]. Lane assumed the role of Hickey, with [[Brian Dennehy]] playing the role of Larry Slade. The production was directed by the Artistic Director of the Goodman Theatre [[Robert Falls]]. It received rave reviews, and became the most successful show in the history of the Goodman. It also won six [[Jeff Award]]s, including Best Ensemble, Director, and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeff Awards|url=http://www.jeffawards.org/search2/index.cfm|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the spring of 2013, he returned to Broadway in ''[[The Nance]]'', a new play by [[Douglas Carter Beane]]; a [[Lincoln Center]] production directed by [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simonson|first=Robert|title=SECOND FLOOR OF SARDI'S: A Drink With Douglas Carter Beane|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/175215-SECOND-FLOOR-OF-SARDIS-A-Drink-With-Douglas-Carter-Beane-/pg1|publisher=Playbill.com|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A reporter once asked Lane if he was gay; he replied, &quot;I'm 40, single and work a lot in the musical theater. You do the math.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3648878/Springtime-for-The-Producers.html&lt;/ref&gt; When he told his mother he was gay, she replied, &quot;I'd rather you were dead,&quot;&lt;ref name=NLGBB&gt;{{cite news |last =Dezell |first= Maureen |title=Nathan Lane goes beyond Broadway |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/10/19/nathan_lane_goes_beyond_broadway/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=boston.com |date=October 19, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which he replied, &quot;I knew you'd understand.&quot; Lane, who [[coming out|came out]] publicly after the death of [[Matthew Shepard]],  has been a long-time board member of and fundraiser for [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]], and has been honored by the [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], and [[The Trevor Project]] for his work in the [[LGBT]] community.

==Career==
[[File:JohnTurturroSept10TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Turturro at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Turturro created the title role of [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s ''Danny and the Deep Blue Sea'' at the Playwrights Conference at the [[Eugene O'Neill]] Theatre Center in 1983. He repeated it the following year [[Off-Broadway]] and won an [[Obie Award]]. [[Spike Lee]] liked Turturro's performance in ''[[Five Corners (film)|Five Corners]]'' so much that he chose to cast him in ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''. This movie was the first of a long-standing collaboration between the famous [[film director|director]] and Turturro, which includes work together on a total of nine films—more than any other actor in the Lee [[Work of art|oeuvre]]--&lt;ref name=NYO&gt;{{cite news|last=Akers|first=W.M.|title=The Long and the Short of It|newspaper=The New York Observer -Fall Arts Preview|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including  ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990), ''[[Jungle Fever]]'' (1991), ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' (1995), ''[[Girl 6 (film)|Girl 6]]'' (1996), ''[[He Got Game]]'' (1998), ''[[Summer of Sam]]'' (1999), ''[[She Hate Me]]'' (2004), and ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]]'' (2008).
A versatile actor comfortable with both comedy and drama, Turturro also had an extended collaboration with the [[Coen Brothers]], appearing in their films ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' (1990), ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991), ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000). He has also appeared in several of [[Adam Sandler]]'s movies, such as ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' (2002) and ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008). He played a severely disturbed patient of [[Jack Nicholson]]'s in the comedy ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' and played [[Johnny Depp]]'s antagonist in ''[[Secret Window]]''. Turturro hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1994, where he spoofed his recent film ''[[Quiz Show]]'', being told he was ineligible to host unless he answered questions in a booth and if he failed, the honor of hosting would go to [[Joey Buttafuoco]], who was actually backstage to witness Turturro's test.

He won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Adrian Monk's brother [[Ambrose Monk|Ambrose]] in the [[USA Network]] series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', and has reprised the role on numerous occasions. He has also been nominated and won many awards from film organizations such as [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Golden Globes]] and others.

Turturro produced and directed, as well as acted in, the film ''[[Illuminata (film)|Illuminata]]'' (1999), which also starred his wife Katherine Borowitz. He wrote and directed the film ''[[Romance and Cigarettes]]'' (2005). In 2006 he appeared in [[Robert De Niro]]'s ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'', and as the Sector 7 agent Simmons in three films of the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' live-action series]]. In 2010 he directed (and had cameo on-screen appearances in) ''[[Passione (movie)|Passione]]'', which chronicles the rich musical heritage of [[Naples|Naples, Italy]].

His stage directorial debut was in October 2011, with the Broadway play &quot;Relatively Speaking,&quot; in which he guided an ensemble of  veteran actors in a production of three comedic one-act plays, written by [[Elaine May]], [[Woody Allen]] and [[Ethan Coen]]. The cast included [[Julie Kavner]], [[Marlo Thomas]],  [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Steve Guttenberg]].&lt;ref name=NYO /&gt;

==Personal life==
Turturro's brothers are actor [[Nicholas Turturro]] and artist Ralph Turturro. Actress [[Aida Turturro]]  is his cousin. He has two children, Amedeo (born 1990) and Diego (born 2000), with his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz.&lt;ref name=&quot;religion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfefferman |first=Naomi |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/the_arts_19980420/ |title=JewishJournal.com |publisher=JewishJournal.com |date=1998-04-19 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his film work, he has received three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, including as Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture—Comedy/Musical for [[Woody Allen]]’s ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985) (hence the name of his theater company). He has also received nominations by the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Satellite Awards]], and several others for his work in ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]'' (London Critics Circle Awards, [[Independent Spirit Awards]], Chlotrudis Awards and Gotham Awards). He played [[Debra Winger]]’s husband in the 1983 Oscar-winning film ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''. Currently, he stars as Will McAvoy in the television series ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]''.

Daniels was born in [[Athens, Georgia]], the son of Marjorie J. (née Ferguson) and Robert Lee “Bob” Daniels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/annarbor/obituary.aspx?pid=159655471 |title=Robert Lee Daniels Obituary: View Robert Daniels's Obituary by AnnArbor.com |publisher=Obits.mlive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lai |first=Daniel |url=http://chelsea.patch.com/articles/bob-daniels-chelsea-lumber-founder-dies-at-age-83 |title=Bob Daniels, Chelsea Lumber Owner, Dies at Age 83 - Chelsea, MI Patch |publisher=Chelsea.patch.com |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Georgia for six weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7C16154E7487E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=NewsBank for AJC &amp;#124; www.ajc.com |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Chelsea, Michigan]]; his father owned a [[lumber yard]] in Chelsea, until his death in 2012, and had once served as the city’s mayor. Daniels was raised [[Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://preview.gospelcom.net/interviews/winndixie.html Preview Interview with Cast of Because of Winn-Dixie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Central Michigan University]] and participated in the school’s theater program. In the summer of 1976, Daniels attended the Eastern Michigan University drama school to participate in a special Bicentennial Repertory program, where he performed in Hot L Baltimore and three other plays performed in repertoire. Marshall Mason was the guest director at EMU and he invited Jeff to come to New York to work at the Circle Repertory Theatre, where he performed in The Fifth of July by Lanford Wilson in the 1977–78 season. He also performed in New Mexico in ''The Shortchanged Review'' (1979) at [[Second Stage Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americantheaterwing.com/downstagecenter/detail/jeff_daniels Downstage Center interview broadcast April 20, 2007].

==Career==

===Stage career===
Daniels has starred in a number of New York productions, on and off Broadway. On Broadway, he has appeared in [[Lanford Wilson]]’s ''[[Redwood Curtain]]'', [[A. R. Gurney]]’s ''[[The Golden Age (Gurney play)|The Golden Age]]'' and Wilson’s ''[[Fifth of July]]'', for which he won a [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Off-Broadway, he received a Drama Desk nomination for Wilson’s ''Lemon Sky'', and an [[Obie Award]] for his performance in the [[Circle Repertory Company]] production of ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]''. He returned to the stage in 2009, appearing in Broadway’s ''[[God of Carnage]]'' with [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Hope Davis]], and [[James Gandolfini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hJUlaeIU9r4lgCGrOgOyjQlbIbMAD95LP6QG0 Gandolfini Stars on Broadway in God of Carnage] The Associated Press, January 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he founded the regionally acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purplerosetheatre.org Live Professional Stage Theatre in Chelsea, Michigan, at The Purple Rose Theatre]. Purplerosetheatre.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Purple Rose Theatre Company, a nonprofit stage company in his childhood and current home of Chelsea, Michigan. He is currently executive director of PRTC and has written 15 plays for them.

===Film career===
Daniels made his screen debut in [[Miloš Forman]]’s ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' in 1981. His next film, the Oscar-winning ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' in which he played [[Debra Winger]]’s husband was his breakthrough. Daniels then garnered a Golden Globe nomination as the star of ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' directed by [[Woody Allen]].

Daniels earned his second Golden Globe nomination for starring in [[Jonathan Demme]]’s dramedy ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' as an unassuming businessman swept up into a wild night by a mysterious woman ([[Melanie Griffith]]).  Daniels then starred in the horror–comedy ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' in 1990. The next year Daniels starred in two films (''[[Love Hurts]]'' and ''[[The Butcher's Wife]]'') and hosted NBC’s legendary sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Daniel’s next notable role was as Colonel [[Joshua Chamberlain]] in ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]''. Alongside Daniels were [[Tom Berenger]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]], and [[Sam Elliot]]. The two-part film proved so popular on television that the 262-minute movie garnered a theatrical release. Daniels would reprise the role of Chamberlain ten years later in the prequel film ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'', with much of the same cast except for Sheen, who was replaced by [[Robert Duvall]].

In 1994 Daniels would have one of his most successful films commercially, starring in the [[Farrelly Brothers]]’ hit ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' alongside [[Jim Carrey]]. It was a noted departure for Daniels, owing to his status as a dramatic heavyweight. Also in ’94 was the [[Keanu Reeves]] action blockbuster ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''. Daniels starred as Reeves’s partner on the LAPD bomb squad, in a race against time to defuse a bomb planted on a bus, set to explode if the bus’s speed falls below 50 miles per hour. Also starring [[Dennis Hopper]] and [[Sandra Bullock]], ''Speed'' was an enormous hit, grossing over $350 million at the box office.

Daniels would then host ''Saturday Night Live'' a second time before the release of the 1996 Disney remake of ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''. Daniels starred as the owner of a litter of dalmatians stolen by the evil [[Cruella De Vil]] ([[Glenn Close]]). The film was a rousing success, grossing $320 million. Also in 1996 was the family hit film ''[[Fly Away Home]]'' with Daniels as the supportive single father of [[Anna Paquin]]’s goose-raising preteen. Daniels then had a critical and commercial misfire with 1997’s ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'' alongside [[Seinfeld]]'s [[Michael Richards]].

Daniels would rebound, however, with 1998’s ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' as diner owner Bill Johnson, who learns to act as an individual and rebel against the norm at the urging of [[Tobey Macguire]]’s David. Also starring [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Joan Allen]], and [[Don Knotts]], ''Pleasantville'' was one of the best-reviewed films of the year, nominated for three Academy Awards. Daniels would then star alongside [[Christopher Lloyd]] in the critical and commercial bomb ''[[My Favorite Martian (film)|My Favorite Martian]]''. The film severely damaged Daniels’s status as a box office star and he would proceed to work in increasingly less mainstream starring roles.

Daniels then starred in the TV films ''[[The Crossing (2000 film)|The Crossing]]'', ''[[Cheaters (film)|Cheaters]]'', and direct-to-video release ''[[Chasing Sleep]]''. At this point, in the early 2000s Daniels began to focus more on his theater work at The Purple Rose Theatre as well as writing, starring, and directing the films ''[[Escanaba in da Moonlight]]'' and ''[[Super Suckers]]''.

Daniels’s next major film role would be in [[Clint Eastwood]]’s ''[[Blood Work (film)|Blood Work]]''. The film received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. He would rebound later that year with [[Stephen Daldry]]’s Academy Award–winning ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', alongside [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Julianne Moore]]. The film was also a monetary success, grossing well over $100 million. ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' followed in 2003, as did the action film ''[[I Witness]]'', co-starring [[James Spader]]. Daniels then starred in ''[[Imaginary Heroes]]'' and the 2004 television film adaptation of fellow Michigander and friend [[Mitch Albom]]’s bestseller ''[[The Five People You Meet in Heaven]]''.

2005 proved to be a strong year for Daniels as he garnered notice as the star of the lauded [[Noah Baumbach]] film ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]''. Daniels received his third Golden Globe nomination for the film, about a divorcing couple and the effect the split has on their children. That year Daniels also starred in the family film adaptation of ''[[Because of Winn-Dixie (film)|Because of Winn-Dixie]]''. He would round out the year with a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated film ''[[Good Night and Good Luck]]'' directed by [[George Clooney]].

Daniels then starred as the redneck comic foil to [[Robin Williams]]’s uptight business man in the vacation comedy ''[[RV (film)|RV]]'' directed by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]. He had a supporting role in the Truman Capote biopic ''[[Infamous (film)|Infamous]]'' and in two other independent films ''[[Mama’s Boy]]'' and ''[[The Lookout]]'', for which he was nominated for a Satellite Award.

Daniels then had a starring voice-over role as the villain Zartog in animated film ''[[Space Chimps]]''.  Daniels then took back-to-back supporting roles in political thrillers: ''[[Traitor (film)|Traitor]]'' with [[Don Cheadle]] and ''[[State of Play (film)|State of Play]]'' with [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Rachel McAdams]]. Also in 2009 Daniels would appear in indie hit ''[[Away We Go]]''. 2010 would prove to be a slow year for Daniels, as he continued his theater work and had a starring role in the little-seen indie ''[[Howl (film)|Howl]]'' alongside [[James Franco]] as [[Allen Ginsberg]].

In 2012 he became the new voice for Apple with the iPhone 5 ads.

===Musical career===
He has focused on recording a number of songs that he has written throughout his life, apparently marking key moments. He has kept busy with frequent gigs and five full-length albums, ''Jeff Daniels Live and Unplugged'', ''Jeff Daniels Live at The Purple Rose Theater'', ''Grandfather's Hat'', ''Keep It Right Here'', and ''Together Again''. Proceeds from the album sales benefit The Purple Rose Theater.

Daniels was featured on the cover of the April–May 2011 issue of Guitar Aficionado magazine as well as the July–August 2011 issue of Making Music Magazine, where he discussed his experiences with music.

==Personal life==
Daniels has been married to his high school sweetheart, Kathleen Rosemary Treado, since 1979. They married on Friday the 13th &lt;!-- indeterminate between April &amp; July, don't bother --&gt;because he wore the number 13 on his baseball uniform.

In 1986 Daniels moved his home to Chelsea, Michigan, where the couple had grown up. They have three children: Benjamin (born 1984), Lucas (born 1987), and Nellie (born 1990). 

He has appeared as the TV spokesman for the [[Michigan]] Economic Development Corporation promoting Michigan’s effectiveness in bringing in new companies,{{Vague|date=July 2009}} featured on [[CNBC]].

Daniels was inducted into the [[Michigan Walk of Fame]] on May 25, 2006, in [[Lansing, Michigan]], and delivered the winter commencement address at the [[University of Michigan]] on December 20, 2009, at which he was granted an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lichterman|first=Joseph|title=Actor and Michigan native Jeff Daniels challenges graduates to make a difference at Winter Commencement|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/2009-winter-commencement|accessdate=May 19, 2010|newspaper=The Michigan Daily |date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purple Rose Theatre Company==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2012}}
[[Image:Purple Rose Theater.JPG|thumb|Purple Rose Theatre]]
The '''Purple Rose Theatre Company''' (or '''PRTC''') was founded by Jeff Daniels in 1991. Originally known as the Garage Theatre, 'The Rose' takes its name from [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] 1985 film ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' starring Daniels. The [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] provides resources for training [[actors]], [[playwrights]]  and other theatre artists residing in the [[Midwest]] region and develops new plays based on life in the [[Great Lakes Basin]], USA.  

The main performance space and administrative offices occupy a building in Chelsea, Michigan once owned by Daniels’s grandfather. The theatre produces four shows a year on a 3/4 [[thrust stage]] in a 168 seat house. The PRTC is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization and operates under a Small Professional Theatre (SPT) Agreement with the [[Actors' Equity Association]] (AEA).

===Apprentice program===
The Purple Rose offers a year-long [[apprenticeship]] program for young artists entering a career in [[theatre]]. Apprentices are paid a 'modest stipend' and work as many as 60–80 hours per week gaining experience in lighting, sound, stage management, design, set construction, and administrative/box office work. The seven apprentices also maintain and clean the theatre's facilities. The program was inspired by Jeff Daniels’s experience as an apprentice with the [[Circle Repertory Company]] in [[New York City]].

'''Lisa Gay Hamilton''' (born March 25, 1964) is an American film, television, and theater actress known for her role as [[lawyer|attorney]] Rebecca Washington on the ABC [[legal drama]] ''[[The Practice]]'', and for her critically acclaimed performance as young Sethe in [[Jonathan Demme|Jonathan Demme's]] film adaptation of [[Toni Morrison|Toni Morrison's]] ''[[Beloved (film)|Beloved]]''. Her theater credits include ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' (Isabella), ''Henry IV Parts I &amp; II'' (Lady Hotspur), [[Athol Fugard|Athol Fugard’s]], ''Valley Song'' and ''The Ohio State Murders''. Hamilton was also an original cast member in the Broadway productions of [[August Wilson|August Wilson’s]], ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' and ''[[Gem of the Ocean]]''.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Los Angeles, California but spent most of her childhood in [[Stony Brook, New York]] on [[Long Island]].  Her father, Ira Winslow Hamilton, Jr., hailed from [[Bessemer, Alabama]], and her mother, the former Eleanor Albertine &quot;Tina&quot; Blackwell, was from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. Both parents graduated from historically black colleges—Tina attended [[Talladega College|Talladega]] while Ira went to [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]]—and they both became successful professionals. Ira worked for a while as an engineer and then went into business as a general contractor. Tina eventually earned a Masters degree in social work and worked for the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;LisaGaye Hamilton, 'Growing Up Female is a Journey,' in ''Becoming Myself: Reflections on Growing Up Female'', ed. By Willa Shalit, (New York: Hyperion Books, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton fell in love with theater at an early age. During the 1970s, she saw several off-Broadway productions by the [[Negro Ensemble Company]], including ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' and ''The First Breeze of Summer''.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. G. Kelley, 'Freedom is Living': LisaGaye Hamilton’s Radical Imagination,' ''Transforming Anthropology'' 14, no. 1 (April 2006), 2-9.&lt;/ref&gt; She enrolled in [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to study theater, but after a year was accepted into [[New York University|New York University’s]] Tisch Drama School.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After graduating in 1985, she earned a second BFA from [[The Juilliard School]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Career==
Early on, Hamilton set her sights on classical theater. In one of her first notable roles, she played opposite [[Kevin Kline]] in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' in the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Her performances in Much Ado About Nothing, Tartuffe, Reckless, Family of Mann, and Two Gentlemen of Verona, earned her a reputation as a serious dramatic actor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1995-96, her portrayal of a young, aspiring South African singer in [[Athol Fugard|Athol Fugard's]] ''Valley Song'' garnered an [[Obie Award]], the [[Clarence Derwent Award]], the Ovation nomination for best actress,  and a [[Drama Desk]] nomination. More recently, Hamilton earned critical acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/theater/reviews/07ohio.html - Charles Isherwood, 'A College is Stalked By Attitude,' ''New York Times'', November 7, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; her second Obie, and a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for her role as Suzanne Alexander in [[Adrienne Kennedy|Adrienne Kennedy’s]], ''The Ohio State Murders''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisagayhamilton.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.lisagayhamilton.com/ Hamilton's web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton appeared in over two dozen films, including ''[[The Truth About Charlie]]'' and ''[[Beloved (film)|Beloved]]'' for director [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Clint Eastwood|Clint Eastwood’s]] ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'', the independent films; ''[[Palookaville (film)|Palookaville]]'', ''[[Drunks]]'', Showtime’s ''[[A House Divided (film)|A House Divided]]'', and as Ophelia in director [[Campbell Scott|Campbell Scott’s]] film version of ''[[Hamlet]]''. She has worked on several projects with director [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo García]], notably his films  ''Ten Tiny Love Stories'', ''[[Nine Lives (2005 film)|Nine Lives]]'', and ''[[Mother and Child (film)|Mother and Child]]''. ''[[Honeydripper (film)|Honeydripper]]'' directed by John Sayles and ''[[The Soloist]]'', directed by Joe Wright.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisagayhamilton.com&quot;/&gt;

She directed the documentary film ''[[Beah: A Black Woman Speaks]]'' in 2003. This film, about pioneering black actress [[Beah Richards]], dealt with Hamilton seeking out Richards, an African-American actress who had broken ground making inroads for black actresses. The two women met on the set of ''[[Beloved (film)|Beloved]]''. Richards worked on stage and screen, taking small roles in several motion pictures during the 1950s and 1960s, earning an Oscar nomination for her role as Sidney Portier’s mother in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', despite being two years his junior. Richards worked in television as well, making memorable late-career appearances on the series ''[[Designing Women]]'' and ''[[The Practice]]''. Hamilton's film explored Richards' political activism as well as her poetry (her volume, ''A Black Woman Speaks and Other Poems'' was published in 1974).  After Richards died, Hamilton collaborated with illustrator R. Gregory Christie to turn one of her poems into a children's book.  ''Keep Climbing Girls'' was published by Simon and Schuster in 2006.

Hamilton played the role of Melissa in ''[[Men of a Certain Age]]'', an hour-long comedy-drama starring [[Ray Romano]], [[Andre Braugher]], and [[Scott Bakula]] that ran from 2009 to 2011.

In the fall of 2010, Hamilton took a faculty position in the School of Theater for the [[California Institute of the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Personal life==
In August 2009, Hamilton married historian and writer [[Robin D. G. Kelley]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} They reside together in Los Angeles, California.

'''David William Rabe''' (born March 10, 1940) is an American playwright and screenwriter.  He won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1972 (''[[Sticks and Bones]]'') and also received Tony award nominations for Best Play in 1974 (''[[In the Boom Boom Room]]''), 1977 (''[[Streamers]]'') and 1985 (''[[Hurlyburly]]'').

==Personal life==
Rabe was born in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], the son of Ruth (née McCormick), a department store worker, and William Rabe, a teacher and meat packer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/David-Rabe.html David Rabe Film Reference bio]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Roman Catholic schools in Dubuque, and graduated from [[Loras College]], a Catholic [[liberal-arts]] college. 

He began graduate studies in theater at [[Villanova University]], but dropped out and was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[U.S. Army]] in 1965. He served until 1967, spending his last eleven months of service in Vietnam.

Rabe was married to actress [[Jill Clayburgh]] from 1978 until her death November 5, 2010.  He has two children with Clayburgh, actress [[Lily Rabe]] and Michael Rabe. He has one son, Jason Rabe, from his first marriage.

== Career ==
After leaving the service, Rabe returned to Villanova, studying writing and earning an M.A. in 1968. During this time, he began work on the play ''Sticks and Bones'', in which the family represents the ugly underbelly of the [[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Nelson family]] when they are faced with their hopeless son [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] returning home from Vietnam as a blinded vet.

Rabe is known for his loose trilogy of plays drawing on his experiences as an Army draftee in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Sticks and Bones]]'' (1969), the [[Tony Award]]-winning ''[[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]]'' (1971), and ''[[Streamers]]'' (1976).  He has also written ''[[Hurlyburly]]'' (both the play and the screenplay for the film version), and the screenplays for the Vietnam War drama ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989) and the [[The Firm (1993 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Grisham]]'s ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' (1993).

'''Míriam Colón''' (born August 20, 1936) is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] actress and the founder and director of the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater in [[New York City]].

==Early years==
Colón (birth name: '''Míriam Colón Valle'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Colón'''|''' Valle'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  was born in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. She was a young girl in the 1940s when her recently divorced mother moved the family to a public housing project called &quot;[[Residencial Las Casas]]&quot;, located in Barrio Obrero, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. She attended the [[Ramon Baldorioty de Castro]] High School in [[Old San Juan]], where she actively participated in the school's plays. Her first drama teacher, Marcos Colón (no relation) believed that she was very talented and with his help she was permitted to observe the students in the &quot;Drama Department of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]&quot;. She was a good student in high school and was awarded scholarships that enabled her to enroll in the &quot;[[Dramatic Workshop|Dramatic Workshop and Technical Institude]]&quot; and also in &quot;[[Lee Strasberg|The Lee Strasburg Acting Studio]]&quot; in [[New York City]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Career==
In 1953, Colón debuted as an actress in ''Peloteros'' (''Baseball Players''), starring [[Ramón Rivero (Diplo)|Ramón (Diplo) Rivero]], a film produced in Puerto Rico, and in which she played a character called &quot;Lolita.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prpop.org/biografias/m_bios/miriam_colon.shtml Miriam Colon]&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Colón moved to New York City, where she was accepted by [[Actors Studio]] co-founder [[Elia Kazan]] after a single audition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote= |title='Look, Let's Have Justice Around Here' |first=Patricia |last=Bosworth |url=https://www.google.com/search?pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=nws&amp;gl=us&amp;as_q=%22Kazan%20accepted%20her%20into%20the%20Actors%20Studio%20after%20a%20single%22&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_drrb=a&amp;tbs=ar%3A1&amp;authuser=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=ekjrth&amp;gs_nf=3&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=serp&amp;tok=TN4kNNVetFyUZUq7DIlA2g&amp;ds=n&amp;pq=%22kazan%22%20%22actors%20studio%22%20%22audition%22%20%22miriam%20colon%22&amp;cp=32&amp;gs_id=2o&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=%22Kazan%22%20%22Actors%20Studio%22%20%22single%20audition%22%20%22Miriam%20Colon%22&amp;pf=p&amp;tbo=d&amp;gl=us&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbs=ar:1&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=%22Kazan%22+%22Actors+Studio%22+%22single+audition%22+%22Miriam+Colon%22&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=9d5cd7c13550ffa6&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=594 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1971-09-12 |page=D5 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=277|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus becoming the Studio's first Puerto Rican member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lessons Feature Hispanic `Heroes' |first=Sylvia |last=Moreno |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103378517.html?dids=103378517:103378517&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+13%2C+1989&amp;author=By+Sylvia+Moreno&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Lessons+Feature+Hispanic+%60Heroes'&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Newsday |date=1989-06-13 |page=30 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, Colón

Colón appeared in the 1961 film ''[[One-Eyed Jacks|One-eyed Jacks]]'' as &quot;the Redhead&quot;. In 1979, she starred alongside fellow Puerto Rican actors [[José Ferrer]], [[Raúl Juliá]], and [[Henry Darrow]] in ''Life of Sin'', a film in which she portrayed [[Isabel la Negra]], a real-life Puerto Rican brothel owner. In 1983, she played the mother of Tony Montana (played by [[Al Pacino]]) in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]].''

Hawke obtained his mother's permission to attend his first casting call at age 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/oct/08/features.fiction|title=Another sunrise|last=Halpern|first=Dan|date=October 8, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured his first film role in 1985's ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]'', in which he played alongside [[River Phoenix]] as an alien-obsessed schoolboy who builds a spacecraft with his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E2DB1738F931A25754C0A963948260|title=The Screen: 'Explorers'|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=July 12, 1985|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/explorers/|title=Explorer Movie Reviews|date=July 12, 1985|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made poor box office revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Betsy|last=Pickle|title=Northern Lights&amp;nbsp;— Ethan Hawke Relishes All He Learned Making 'White Fang'|date=February 4, 1991|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a failure which Hawke has admitted caused him to quit acting for a brief period after the film's release. Hawke later described the disappointment as difficult to bear at such a young age, adding &quot;I would never recommend that a kid act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;payoff&quot;/&gt; His next film appearance was not until 1989's comedy drama ''[[Dad (film)|Dad]]'', where he played [[Ted Danson]]'s son and [[Jack Lemmon]]'s grandson.&lt;ref name=&quot;payoff&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance, playing shy student Todd Anderson opposite [[Robin Williams]]'s inspirational English teacher in ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; The film was critically well-received;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dead-poets-society/|title=Dead Poets Society (1989): Reviews|date=June 2, 1989|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer wrote &quot;Hawke&amp;nbsp;... gives a haunting performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790298?refcatid=31|title=Dead Poets Society Review|date=January 1, 1989|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With revenue of $235&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, the film remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=ethanhawke.htm|title=Ethan Hawke Movie Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: &quot;I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the [film's] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot; /&gt;

Hawke's next film, 1991's ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s [[White Fang|novel of the same name]], featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a [[Yukon]] gold hunter who befriends a [[wolfdog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166788,00.html|title=White Fang|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=December 17, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Oregonian]]'', &quot;Hawke does a good job as young Jack, being both physically robust but still boyishly naive. He makes Jack's passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ted|last=Mahar|title='White Fang': A Boy, A Mine And A Dog|date=January 24, 1991|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=C14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke then appeared in ''[[A Midnight Clear]]'' (1992), a well-received war film by [[Keith Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920501/REVIEWS/205010305/1023|title=A Midnight Clear|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=May 1, 1992|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1993's ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'', an adaptation of [[Piers Paul Read]]'s 1974 book, ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305303,00.html|title=Alive (Movie&amp;nbsp;– 1993) |last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=January 15, 1993|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–2000: Critical success===
Hawke's next part, in the [[Generation X]] drama ''[[Reality Bites]]'' (1994) as Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love interest (played by [[Winona Ryder]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;rickey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickey|first=Carrie|title=Generation X Turns Its Back|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|page=L01|date=April 3, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; received critical acclaim. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: &quot;Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940218/REVIEWS/402180303/1023|title=Reality Bites|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 18, 1994|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' noted, &quot;Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html?pagewanted=all|title=Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething|last=James|first=Caryn|date=February 18, 1994|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the film was a surprise box office disappointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rickey&quot;/&gt;

The following year Hawke again received critical praise, this time for his performance in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1995 drama ''[[Before Sunrise]]''. The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman ([[Julie Delpy]]), who meet on a train and disembark in [[Vienna]], spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/01/27/DD52018.DTL|title=An Extraordinary Day Dawns 'Before Sunrise'|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=January 27, 1995|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: &quot;[they] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barbara&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/01/27/WEEKEND15835.dtl|title=Modern &quot;Roman Holiday' alive and well in Vienna|last=Shulgasser|first=Barbara|date=January 27, 1995|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from acting, Hawke directed the music video for the 1994 song &quot;[[Stay (I Missed You)]]&quot; by singer-songwriter [[Lisa Loeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/dec/19/comment|title=The best Ethan Hawke scene|date=December 19, 2000|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 16, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published his first novel in 1996, ''The Hottest State'', about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, &quot;Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot;/&gt; The book met with a mixed reception. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that Hawke &quot;opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in ''The Hottest State''. If Hawke is serious&amp;nbsp;... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues, perhaps focusing on shorter stories and submitting them to little magazines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294593,00.html|title=The Hottest State&amp;nbsp;— Book Review|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=October 18, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' thought Hawke did &quot;a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion&quot;, concluding that ''The Hottest State'' was ultimately &quot;a sweet love story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/love-hurts.html|title=Love Hurts|last=Nessel|first=Jen|date=November 3, 1996|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Andrew Niccol]]'s science fiction film ''[[Gattaca]]'' (1997), &quot;one of the more interesting scripts&quot; Hawke said he had read in &quot;a number of years&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kenneth M.|last=Chanko|title=Hawke-ing the future in science-fiction thriller 'Gattaca'|date=October 26, 1997|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|page=E–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity in order to realize his dream of space travel. Although ''Gattaca'' was not a success at the box office&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot; /&gt; it drew generally favorable reviews from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gattaca|title=Gattaca (1997): Reviews|date=October 24, 1997|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawke's performance was critically well-received. The ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' reviewer wrote that &quot;Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael H.|last=Price|title=Gattaca Well-conceived sci-fi|date=October 24, 1997|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1998 saw Hawke appearing in ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'', a contemporary film adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] [[Great Expectations|novel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9802/06/great.expectations/|title=Review: What the Dickens is 'Great Expectations'?|last=Tatara|first=Paul|date=February 6, 1998|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborating for a second time with director Richard Linklater in ''[[The Newton Boys]]'', based on the true story of the [[Newton Gang]], a family of bank robbers from [[Uvalde, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/03/27/DD28206.DTL|title=Bank-Robbing `Newton' Brothers Show Boys Will Be Boys|last=Stack|first=Peter|date=March 27, 1998|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Hawke starred in ''[[Snow Falling on Cedars (film)|Snow Falling on Cedars]]'', in which he played a reporter named Ishmael Chambers, who, after being wounded in [[World War II]], comes home to take over his family newspaper after his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/07/review.snowfalling/|title=Review: 'Snow Falling on Cedars' a visual feast|last=Clinton|first=Paul|date=January 7, 2000|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, based on [[David Guterson]]'s novel of the [[Snow Falling on Cedars|same title]], received ambivalent reviews and ''Entertainment Weekly'' concluded, &quot;Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we have no idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275053,00.html|title=Snow Falling on Cedars&amp;nbsp;— Movie Review|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=January 7, 2000|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared that year in [[Frank Whaley]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Joe the King]]'' (1999).

Hawke's next film role was in [[Michael Almereyda]]'s 2000 film ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'', in which he played the [[Prince Hamlet|title character]]. The film transposed the famous [[William Shakespeare]] [[Hamlet|play]] to contemporary New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/hamlethowe.htm|title='Hamlet': A Melancholy Dude |last=Howe|first=Desson|date=May 19, 2000|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technique Hawke felt made the play more &quot;accessible and vital&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/a-renaissance-man-tackles-shakespeare-hamlet-s-ethan-hawke-mind-movie-stardom-article-1.869336|title=A Renaissance Man tackles Shakespeare 'Hamlet's' Ethan Hawke has more on his mind than movie stardom|last=Dominguez|first=Robert|date=May 11, 2000|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' reviewer wrote: &quot;Hawke certainly isn't the greatest Hamlet of living memory&amp;nbsp;... but his performance reinforces Hamlet's place as Shakespeare's greatest character.

Hawke's next role, and one for which he received substantial critical acclaim, came in ''[[Training Day]]'' (2001). Hawke played rookie cop Jake Hoyt, alongside [[Denzel Washington]], as one of a pair of narcotics detectives from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] spending 24 hours in the gang neighborhoods of [[South Los Angeles]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Buckingham County, Virginia]] but raised in [[Harlem, New York]], Taylor was best known for her recurring role on television on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as Dr. Heathcliff &quot;Cliff&quot; Huxtable's ([[Bill Cosby]]) mother, Anna Huxtable. She was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in [[1986 in television|1986]] for the role. She was also a regular on ''[[Nurse (1981 TV series)|Nurse]]'', played Harriet on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and appeared as Grady's cousin Emma on ''[[Sanford and Son]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Hevesi |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Clarice Taylor Dies at 93; TV’s Cosby Called her Mom |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/arts/television/clarice-taylor-dies-at-93-tvs-cosby-called-her-mom.html?ref=deathsobituaries |date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor started working in the theatre—with the American Negro Theatre—at a time when there were few opportunities for [[African-American]] actors. To support herself she followed in the footsteps of her father, Leon B. Taylor, Sr., and went to work for the [[U.S. Post Office]]. In the 1960s she got her big break that enabled her to act full-time. Taylor was one of the founding members of the [[Negro Ensemble Company]], headquartered in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place|St. Mark's Place]].

==Film work==
While working with the NEC she got her first offer of a movie role in ''Change of Mind''. Her next film role was as &quot;Minnie&quot; in [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]''. In 1971 she played Birdie in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Play Misty For Me]]''. In 1973, she brought a role she had pioneered off-Broadway to film, playing Gladys Brooks in ''[[Five on the Blackhand Side]]''.

==Stage==
Taylor appeared in ''[[The Wiz]]'' as Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North.&lt;ref name=boston /&gt; Her most recent performance was in a touring production of her own one-woman show, ''Moms'', for which she won an [[Obie Award]]. Her most recent film appearance was a small role in [[Wayne Wang]]'s film ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.

==Death==
Clarice Taylor died at her home in [[Englewood, New Jersey]] from congestive heart failure, aged 93.&lt;ref name=boston /&gt; She is survived by her two sons: William and James, her daughter-in-law, Gizele, and four grandchildren: Jason, Kristen, Raul Jr. and Jared.&lt;ref name=people /&gt;

'''The Talking Band''' is an American [[Off-Off-Broadway]] [[theatre company]] specializing in [[experimental theatre]], based in [[New York City]], [[New York]].

The group consists of a three-person core group of artists{{spaced ndash}}artistic director [[Paul Zimet]]; actor, writer and composer [[Ellen Maddow]]; and actor and director [[Tina Shepard (actor)|Tina Shepard]]. 

It is known for producing original works of theater that combine music, language, and choreographed movement in unconventional ways to create unique audience perspective on a wide range of subject material. Since its founding, the group has produced 46 original plays, and has performed its plays at theater venues around New York City and throughout the world.

== History ==
The group was founded in 1974 by Maddow and Shepard and Zimet, along with Sybille Hayn, Mark Samuels, Margo Lee Sherman, Charles Stanley and Arthur Strimling. It has its roots in the work of [[The Open Theatre]], where company members Maddow and Shepard and Zimet worked as core company members. The Open Theatre had been founded by director, actor and writer [[Joseph Chaikin]], and after Chaikin disbanded The Open Theatre in 1973, Maddow, Shepard and Zimet joined with the other Talking Band founding members to start the new company. Along with starting The Talking Band, Zimet, Maddow and Shepard continued to perform with Chaikin as part of his new company [[The Winter Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Donn.

== Productions ==
Its first production, ''The Kalevala''{{spaced ndash}}based on the [[Kalevala]], a 19th-century work of [[epic poetry]] compiled by [[Elias Lönnrot]] from [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]] oral [[folklore]] and [[Finnish mythology]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160078&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US|accessdate=August 15, 2010|title=Kalevala: The Finnish National Epic|author=Asplund, Anneli; Mettom, Sirkka-Liisa|date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}featured music by [[Elizabeth Swados]], and used minimal staging. The piece centered on the use of actor voices and the rhythms and melodies of the language. It received critical praise from ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which said, &quot;it is as if the almost formal sense of using the breath opens the performers to the depths of an innerness that is sometimes like Alice in its sense of wonder and sometimes like [[Dante]] in its terribleness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkingband.org/our-work/the-kalevala/ ''The Kalevala'' Show Page].  The Talking Band.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its productions evolved over the years, incorporating poetry, dialog, and multi-media elements, alongside music and choreographed movement. The group's pieces have focused on a wide range of subjects, from the travails of a housewife, to [[Christianity]] and [[nuclear disarmament]]. 

The group has been regularly praised by critics for its creative and innovative productions. ''[[American Theatre (magazine)|American Theatre]]'' referred to it as &quot;...one of the most exceptional but unsung theatre companies in the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(October 2008).  &quot;Falling Light&quot;.  ''[[American Theatre (magazine)|American Theatre]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 four playwrights wrote a serial play, ''The Necklace'', based on themes and structures that they would develop over a year's time. [[Ellen Maddow]], in an interview in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'', says of the experience: &quot;I’ve worked in collaborative theatre all my life but to work collaboratively with other playwrights is something unusual. It’s a kind of tug and pull of four different peoples minds and ways of thinking. And the ways you are pushed in a certain direction by someone else’s aesthetic is very interesting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babb|first=Roger|title=In Dialogue: Talking Band’s The Necklace: A serial mystery in eight episodes|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|year=2006|month=May|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/05/theater/talking-bands-the-necklace-a-serial-mystery-in-eight-episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane White''' (October 30, 1922 – July 24, 2011) was an actress of African-American and European descent. Born in [[New York City]], she attended [[Smith College]] and [[The New School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss188.html Jane White archived papers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1945, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[Strange Fruit]]''.

In 1959, she opened the acclaimed musical, ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', originating the role of Queen Aggravain alongside [[Carol Burnett]] and [[Joseph Bova]].&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Daniel, ed. ''Theatre World: Season 1959-60''. Vol. 16. Philadelphia: Chilton Company, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; She won an [[Obie Award]] in 1971 for sustained achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in the Theatre. &quot;Jane White.&quot; 17th ed. Gale Research, 1981. Document Number: K1652002072 [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Reproduced in Biography Resource Center.] Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jane was born to [[Walter Francis White]], a notable civil-rights leader and national secretary of the [[NAACP]] from 1931 to 1955, and Gladys Leah Powell. She grew up in the fashionable [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]] neighborhood of [[Harlem]] at 409 Edgecombe Avenue. The house was nicknamed &quot;The White House of Harlem&quot; because of the prominent and important figures who were part of her parents' circle. She had one brother, Walter Carl Darrow White.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Walter Francis White/Civil Rights Leader&quot;. http://www.hometoharlem.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Jane White Papers, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northhampton, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1945, White secured her first part playing the lead role of &quot;Nonnie&quot; in the Broadway production of ''[[Strange Fruit]]''. The play was an adaptation of the controversial novel about interracial love in the South. She was originally recommended for the part by [[Paul Robeson]], a friend of the White family.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt; The play opened to mixed reviews, but both White and the play received positive attention from [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], then [[First Lady]], who wrote her own review in her column ''My Day''. Of White's performance, Roosevelt wrote: ''&quot;I should like to pay tribute to the cast of this play as a whole, but particularly to Jane White whose first venture this is on the stage and who plays her part with restraint and beauty.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/displaydoc.cfm?_y=1945&amp;_f=md000206 Eleanor Roosevelt's ''My Day'']
George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, White played the role of the scheming Queen Aggravain in ''Once Upon a Mattress'', in which [[Carol Burnett]] made her Broadway debut.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

===1970s-2011 (death)===
White continued to work steadily in theatre and occasionally in television and movies from the 1970s through the 2000s. Her theatrical work has spanned summer stock, off-Broadway and on-Broadway shows. Much of her work was in classical dramas, with particular focus on [[Shakespeare]]; she won an Obie Award for her roles in the 1965-66 [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] as [[Volumnia]] in ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' and the Princess of France in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''.  

She won the 1988-89 Los Angeles Critics Circle Award for her role as the Mother in [[Federico Garcia Lorca]]'s ''[[Blood Wedding (play)|Blood Wedding]]''. She has additionally played roles in such dramas as [[Euripides]]' ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'' and [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]''; comedies such as [[Paul Rudnick]]'s ''[[I Hate Hamlet]]''; and musicals such as [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' and the 2001 production of Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]'', to name a small selection.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

In addition to the productions of ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', her television work included a 1979 stint on the soap operas ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[A World Apart (TV series)|A World Apart]]'', and ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''.  She was one of the first African-American actresses to play a role under contract on soap operas when she originated the role of Lyndia Holliday, R. N. on ''[[The Edge of Night]]''. In 1998 she played the schoolteacher Lady Jones in the movie version of [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924936 Jane White IMDb profile]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979-80, White starred in a self-written, one-woman cabaret show entitled ''Jane White, Who?'', which interspersed autobiographical anecdotes and personal reminiscence with songs.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;  As recently as 2006, she continued to perform occasionally in cabaret theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=7985 &quot;Jane White Performs at Feinstein's&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
White attended Smith College beginning in the early 1940s. At the beginning of her freshman year, a fellow student in White's dormitory, who was white, told Smith that she would leave the school unless White were forced to leave. She said she refused to share a dormitory with a woman of color. The college told the girl she was free to leave, but White would remain enrolled and in her current rooming situation.

'''Elliot Goldenthal''' (born May 2, 1954) is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]] of [[contemporary classical music]]. He was a student of [[Aaron Copland]] and [[John Corigliano]], and is best known for his distinctive style and ability to blend various musical styles and techniques in original and inventive ways.  He is also a film-music composer, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in 2002 for his score to the motion picture ''[[Frida]]'', directed by his long-time partner [[Julie Taymor]].

==Life and career==
Goldenthal was born on May 2, 1954, as the youngest son of a Jewish housepainter father and a Catholic seamstress mother in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], where he was influenced from an early age by music from all cultures and genres. Both pairs of Goldenthal's grandparents emigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Bucharest]] and [[Iași]], Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.ro/articol.php?id=112097 |title=Interviu în exclusivitate cu Elliot Goldenthal|publisher=[[Romanian Television|TVR.ro]]| |language= Romanian| date=2011-10-08 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldenthal lived in a multi-cultural part of town, and this is reflected in his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/Elliot+Goldenthal/biography/57588/family/ Elliot Goldenthal - Family and Companions - Yahoo! Singapore Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended John Dewey High School in Brooklyn where, at the age of 14, he had his very first ballet ''Variations on Early Glimpses'' performed; he continued to display his eclectic musical range, performing with rock bands in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--None of this is mentioned on either of the cited items at the end of the paragaph.--&gt; He then studied music full time at the prestigious [[Manhattan School of Music]], where he studied with composer [[John Corigliano]] (whom he greatly admired), to earn his Bachelor of Music degree (1977) and Master of Music (1979) in musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Elliot_Goldenthal/187208 Elliot Goldenthal at Hollywood.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack.net&quot;&gt;Dan Goldwasser &quot;[http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=51 The Sweet Revenge of Elliot Goldenthal]&quot;.

He lives in [[New York City]] &quot;happily unmarried&quot;, as he once put it,&lt;ref name=&quot;Filmtracks: Elliot Goldenthal&quot;&gt;[http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldenthal.shtml Filmtracks: Elliot Goldenthal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with his partner [[Julie Taymor]], whom he met in 1980 through a mutual acquaintance, who told him, &quot;I know a person whose work is just as grotesque as yours&quot;; they have an office/apartment where they both live and work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donshewey.com/arts_articles/taymor_goldenthal.html &quot;Julie Taymor and Elliot Goldenthal: United in Their Love of the Outsider,&quot; by Don Shewey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goldenthal has written works for concert hall, theater, dance and film.
His work includes music for films such as ''[[Alien 3]]'', ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning score for Julie Taymor's &quot;''[[Frida]]''&quot;, a movie in which Goldenthal had a small acting part as a &quot;Newsreel Reporter&quot;. Incidentally he also had a small part in the stage show ''&quot;Juan Darièn&quot;'' as a &quot;Circus Barker / Streetsinger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldenthal.filmmusic.com/concert/juandarien/index.html Elliot Goldenthal Concert &amp; Stage: Juan Darien - A Carnival Mass (1996)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See below for links to individual score pages; some with audio samples''.

The Tony-Award winning carnival mass ''Juan Darièn'' (1988/'96) and ''The Green Bird'' (1999), based on a story by [[Carlo Gozzi]], are a few of the composer's theater works.

In 2006, Goldenthal completed his original three-act opera with Taymor entitled ''Grendel'' an adaptation of the [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] [[Grendel (novel)|novel]] which told the story of Beowulf from the monster's point of view. It had its world premiere in early June 2006 at the [[Los Angeles Opera]], the role of Grendel performed by [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], with an audience containing the likes of [[John Williams]] and [[Emmy Rossum]]; the opus was added to the Los Angeles Opera's permanent repertoire and earned Goldenthal a nomination in April 2007 for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2007/music/ 2007 Pulitzer Prize Winners - PRIZE IN MUSIC, Citation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page1842.html Page Title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Goldenthal reunited with Michael Mann to score 1930s gangster movie ''[[Public Enemies (2009 film)|Public Enemies]]'' and in 2009 he scored another Julie Taymor Shakespeare adaptation, ''[[The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upcomingfilmscores.blogspot.com/2008/04/elliot-goldenthal-public-enemies.html Upcoming Film Scores: Elliot Goldenthal: Public Enemies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He cites acclaimed Japanese composer [[Tōru Takemitsu]] as an influence and someone he styles his own career on; Goldenthal has said that the lines between traditional concert music and orchestral film score have become more blurred which is the way he thinks it should be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot Goldenthal&quot;&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/elliotgoldenthal.asp?print=yes Elliot Goldenthal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also collaborated four times with Irish director [[Neil Jordan]], scoring movies like ''[[Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles]]'' and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.

==Style==
Elliot Goldenthal has been called by film-music collectors the &quot;thinking man's composer&quot; and a generally more cerebral choice for film makers and fans of film music alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-wave.net/titles/demolition_man.html |title=Goldenthal: Demolition Man |publisher=Movie-wave.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/demolition_man.html |title=Demolition Man (Elliot Goldenthal) |publisher=Filmtracks |date=1993-11-23 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his often intense experimentation, intelligent nuances and willingness to try new and [[Musique concrète|unconventional]] [[Experimental music#Techniques|techniques]] and processes (For two good examples of this, see ''[[Alien 3 (soundtrack)]]'' and ''[[Titus (soundtrack)]]''). This experimental approach has led him to score movies in almost every genre from horror to action to Shakespeare adaptations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldenthal.shtml |title=Elliot Goldenthal |publisher=Filmtracks |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only type of film he has not yet scored is comedy, but at the same time he has composed comedic motifs for several films such as ''Demolition Man'' and the more colorful [[Batman Forever|Batman sequels]], which are considered tongue-in-cheek types of movies in the first place. It is this openness to try his hand at anything which has gained him a lot of respect in the music and film communities and with fans. He is not as well known, or popular, as other film composers such as the &quot;household names&quot; John Williams, Danny Elfman, or [[Hans Zimmer]] but he is widely appreciated among film score fans for his sheer musical abilities and distinctive style; a style, which though artistically appreciated among film music enthusiasts, some have said can be too experimental or inaccessible to the mainstream listener because of Goldenthals passion for defying the norms of contemporary classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/elliotgoldenthal.asp?print=yes |title=Elliot Goldenthal |publisher=Soundonsound.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/in_dreams.html |title=In Dreams (Elliot Goldenthal) |publisher=Filmtracks |date=1999-10-12 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemusicuk.us/batforcd.htm |title=Batman Forever |publisher=Moviemusicuk.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/final_fantasy.html |title=Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Elliot Goldenthal) |publisher=Filmtracks |date=2001-07-03 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atonal and brutal in his action music, sometimes in underscore and tends to use very fast French horn bending tones/whining; although Goldenthal himself has said that he doesn't &quot;hear&quot; atonal and tonal, rather ''&quot;...I don't have any differentiation in my head between tonal and atonal, I either hear melody or I hear sonority — I don't hear atonal or tonal so much.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot Goldenthal&quot;/&gt;

{{rquote|right|Every project we do requires a different approach, but one thing that's always consistent is the framework that Rick provides.  In essence, he's giving me all these new instruments to work with. He keeps coming up with surprising combinations of sounds.''|Goldenthal (March 2003), on Richard Martinez&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2003&quot;/&gt;}}
Goldenthal often works with a team he assembled after the soundtrack for ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'':  [[Teese Gohl]] as supervising producer, [[Robert Elhai]] as orchestrator, [[Joel Iwataki]] as sound engineer and [[Richard Martinez (music producer)|Richard Martinez]] as electronic music producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/nyregion/and-the-music-for-frida-produced-in-a-scarsdale-basement.html | title= ...and the Music for 'Frida,' Produced in a Scarsdale Basement | date= March 23, 2003| author= Thomas Staudter | publisher= The New York Times | accessdate=2011-01-30| quote= Bigger film projects then were offered to Mr. Goldenthal, and to meet the demands he assembled a four-person team that included Teese Gohl as supervising producer, Robert Ehlai as orchestrator, Joel Iwataki as sound engineer and Mr.&quot; Martinez, who is known as Rick, as electronic music producer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Martinez,  &quot;a lot of composers want to focus on writing their music, and that's what [his] team allows Elliot to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2003&quot;/&gt;

At the website filmscoremonthly.com, a former classmate of Goldenthal's replied to a piece on the [[Sphere (film)|''Sphere'']] score from 1998 saying that when he and Elliot were both studying at the Manhattan School of Music in the '70s Elliot was already experimenting with unusual techniques and when studying [[trumpet]] once, Elliot asked him to ''&quot;buzz into the wrong end of the mouthpiece and sing into it as well&quot;'', he thought he was crazy but looking back after a decade or so of Goldenthals film and concert music he said that he ''&quot;...was just way ahead of the rest of us.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1998/03_Mar---Spheres_of_Influence(Goldenthal).asp |title=3/3/98: Sphere of Influence (Goldenthal) |publisher=Filmscoremonthly.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respected cultural historian and critic [[Piero Scaruffi]] found fit to mention Goldenthal in lists of honour and general overview of film music on his website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/history/film2.html |title=A History of Film Music |publisher=Scaruffi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing three of Goldenthal's theatre works in a ''&quot;Brief history of music through its milestone compositions&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/music/classic.html |title=A brief History of Music through its milestone compositions |publisher=Scaruffi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and putting his score for [[Drugstore Cowboy (1989 movie)|''Drugstore Cowboy'']] at number 27 in a list of ''&quot;Best musicals of all time&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/music/soundtra.html |title=Best musical of all times |publisher=Scaruffi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Gordon''' is a [[dancer]], [[choreographer]], [[playwright|writer]], [[actor]] and [[theatre director|theatrical director]] prominent in the world of [[postmodern dance]] and [[performance art|performance]].  Based in New York City, Gordon's work has been seen in major performance venues across the United States, Europe, South America and Japan, and has appeared on television on [[PBS]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]'' and ''[[Alive TV]]'', and the [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]] in Great Britain. 

Twice a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] (1981 and 1987), Gordon has been a panelist of the dance program panels of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], and chairman of the former.&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;  He is a member of the [[Actors Studio]], and a founder of the Center for Creative Research.

Gordon is married to [[Valda Setterfield]], a dancer and actress born in [[England]], who was for 10 years a featured soloist with the [[Merce Cunningham|Merce Cunningham Dance Company]].&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;  She appears regularly in Gordon's work, and has been referred to as his &quot;[[muse]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Lisa. &quot;David Gordon: A Cult Choreographer Takes Center Stage&quot;. ''Dial'' (August 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  Their son, playwright and actor [[Ain Gordon]], has collaborated with Gordon on a number of projects.

==Style and process==

Like most postmodernists in dance, Gordon employs pedestrian movement in his work,&lt;ref name=options /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Jowitt|Jowitt, Deborah]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Gordon makes polished patterns out of shambling, plebian movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;'Don't You Wonder What He's Thinking?' 'No'&quot; ''[[Village Voice]]'' (May 29, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; but he is notable for his frequent use of spoken dialogue, even in &quot;dance&quot; pieces, as well as his [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] rejection of illusion coupled with an interest in theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Banes|Banes, Sally]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the debate on theatricality among post-Cunningham choreographers, Gordon stands in favor of spectacle. But he uses spectacular moments and glamorous touches cunningly, often intensifying them until a gap between the movement relationships and their extravagant theatrical overlay throws the movement into high relief.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &quot;David Gordon, or, The Ambiguities&quot; ''[[Village Voice]]'' (May 1, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;   He is quoted as saying &quot;I [want] to use mundane means to a magical end.&quot;&lt;ref name=croce82&gt;[[Arlene Croce|Croce, Arlene]]. &quot;Profiles: Making Work&quot;. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (November 29, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  A contrarian by nature, Gordon creates works which are founded on structural clarity, which he then undercuts: &quot;I always find some way to screw up a fabulously straightforward structure,&quot; Gordon has said, &quot;I can't seem to avoid that.&quot;&lt;ref name=frieze&gt;[[Noël Carroll|Carroll, Noël]]. &quot;Frieze Frame&quot; ''Soho Weekly News'' (December 6, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another of Gordon's hallmarks is his fondness for recycling previously used materials, both choreographic and physical.&lt;ref name=options /&gt; According to critic [[Arlene Croce]]: &quot;Gordon is a collagist.  Many of his dances and set pieces ... can be lifted out of context and combined with new material to make a new impression.&quot;&lt;ref name=croce84&gt;[[Arlene Croce|Croce, Arlene]] &quot;Dancing: Life Studies&quot; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (June 18, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly true with his use of gestures, which when seen in one context can appear meaningless or arbitrary, but which will pick up meaning and appear as deliberate when, for instance, accompanied by music or text.&lt;ref name=frieze /&gt;  According to Gordon: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Movement is ambiguous until you place it against some background. ... I use a great many repetitions with variations to make the ambiguities of movement apparent.  Exploring the alternate possible meanings of gesture is one of my major concerns.&lt;ref name=frieze /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon's pieces frequently reference films and other aspects of popular culture,&lt;ref name=oxford /&gt; and are often autobiographical, or at least apparently so, with the distinction between true facts and fictionalized autobiography deliberately obscured.&lt;ref name=avantauto&gt;[[Amanda Smith|Smith, Amanda]]. &quot;Autobiography and the Avant-Garde&quot;. ''[[Dancemagazine]]'' (January 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;   His pieces often employ humor, sometimes in self-deprecation,&lt;ref&gt;Reiter, Susan. &quot;Man in Demand&quot; ''Ballet News'' (May 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been called one of the few &quot;comic spirits&quot; produced by the postmodern dance movement.&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;

==Early life and career==
Gordon, a native of New York City, was born on July 14, 1936 to Samuel and Rose Gordon.  He grew up on the [[Lower East Side]] and in [[Coney Island]] and graduated from [[Seward Park High School]].  Afterwards, he received a BFA from [[Brooklyn College]],&lt;ref name=ambig&gt;[[Sally Banes|Banes, Sally]]. &quot;David Gordon, or, The Ambiguities&quot; ''[[Village Voice]]'' (May 1, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied English and art,&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt; joined the modern dance club,&lt;ref name=options /&gt; and, at the insistence of a friend, auditioned for and got the lead role of the witch boy in the college's production of ''[[Dark of the Moon (play)|Dark of the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon:&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]s a fine arts major in college, I followed an exceedingly attractive young woman wearing peculiar earrings with live guppies in them to what turned out to be the Modern Dance Club.  Being six feet tall and male, I was immediately put into a performance. At the same time I met another young woman from the Theatre Department who got me to go to an audition for ''Dark of the Moon''.  Two young men were vying vehemently for the role of the witch boy when I walked in, and the director said to me, &quot;Hey you at the back of the room.  Come up here and read.&quot;  I amazed myself by performing with something resembling a southern accent, and immediately got the part.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gordon, David. Remarks made during the &quot;Collaboration: Investigating New Forms&quot; session at the [[Theatre Communications Group]] National Conference in June 1982.  Published in &quot;TCG Focus: Combining Forces&quot; in ''Theatre Communications'' (January 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Just out of school, a chance meeting in [[Washington Square Park]] in 1956 &amp;ndash; &quot;a scene right out of Hollywood&quot;, in his words &amp;ndash; led to Gordon joining the company of [[James Waring]], where he met Setterfield, who had recently followed her friend [[David Vaughan (dancer)|David Vaughan]]&lt;ref name=valda&gt;Robertson, Allen. &quot;Valda Setterfield - The early years&quot; ''Dance Theatre Journal'' (Autumn 1985).&lt;p&gt;Vaughan and Setterfield have remained good friends, and he appeared via photograph as [[the Pope]] in Gordon's ''An Audience with the Pope'', as well as in [[Ain Gordon]]'s ''Art, Life &amp; Show Biz'', again by image only. Vaughan has had a long career as a dancer, choreographer, actor, singer and, notably, the long-time archivist for the [[Merce Cunningham|Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] He is also a prolific dance writer and a scholar on the work of [[Frederick Ashton]].&lt;/ref&gt; from England.&lt;ref name=options /&gt;  Taking the composition class given by [[Robert Ellis Dunn|Judith and Robert Dunn]] led to becoming a founding artist of the [[Judson Dance Theater]] concerts at the [[Judson Church]], which began in 1962 and continued through 1966.&lt;ref name=banesproj&gt;[[Sally Banes|Banes, Sally]]. &quot;Earthly Bodies: Judson Dance Theater&quot; in [[Wendy Perron|Perron, Wendy]] and Cameron, Daniel J. (eds.) ''Judson Dance Theater: 1962-1966'' (exhibition catalogue) Bennington, Vermont: The Bennington College Judson Project, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon made solos and duets for himself and Setterfield, which he showed at the [[Living Theatre]] and the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], among other downtown venues.  They also participated in the &quot;First New York Theater Rally&quot; organized by Waring at the 81st Street Theater, a seminal cross-fertilization event which mixed a new generation of dancer/choreographers such as Gordon, [[Carolyn Brown (choreographer)|Carolyn Brown]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] and the visual artists who were involved in creating the [[Happening]], such as [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Jim Dine]].&lt;ref name=rise270&gt;McDonagh, Don. ''The Rise and Fall and Rise of Modern Dance''. New York: New American Library, 1970. p.272&lt;/ref&gt; 

These early works included: 

*''Mama Goes Where Poppa Goes'' (1960) &amp;ndash; his first duet for himself and Setterfield,
*''Mannequin Dance'' (1962),
*''Helen's Dance'' (1962),
*''Random Breakfast'' (1963) &amp;ndash; in which Setterfield did a striptease, and Gordon impersonated [[Milton Berle]] impersonating [[Carmen Miranda]]; and
*''Silver Pieces (Fragments)'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Pieces (Fragments)'' was performed under two different names, &quot;Fragments&quot; in Philadelphia and &quot;Silver Pieces&quot; at the Judson Church.  The evening-long piece was created from odds and ends of unfinished and abandoned solos and duets for Gordon and Setterfield, tied together with the visual device of a television set, but with no other thematic connection between the constituent parts.  In 1981, Gordon wrote that for the New York performance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I used my home television set sprayed silver.  Valda and I wore tights and leotards sprayed silver and plastic child wigs (like swimming caps) sprayed silver ... [Critic] Don McDonagh said in ''The Rise and Fall and Rise of Modern Dance'' that the dance &quot;. . . was a choreographic look at the ruins of humanity in some horribly projected future.&quot; So much for the intention of the artist, or the lack of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gordon, David. &quot;Fragments&quot; in [[Wendy Perron|Perron, Wendy]] and Cameron, Daniel J. (eds.) ''Judson Dance Theater: 1962-1966'' (exhibition catalogue) Bennington, Vermont: The Bennington College Judson Project, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gordon and Setterfield were described during this period as &quot;amiable saboteurs ... [with] the stylistic skill of old music-hall comedians ... [and] a wickedly perceptive wit.&quot;&lt;ref name=rise279&gt;McDonagh, Don. ''The Rise and Fall and Rise of Modern Dance''. New York: New American Library, 1970. p.279-281&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1966, vociferously negative audience response to his solo piece ''Walks and Digressions'' &amp;ndash; Gordon wrote that &quot;[t]he audience booed, hissed, clapped, stamped their feet, and walked out across the performance space while I was working&quot;&lt;ref  name=tdr&gt;Gordon, David. &quot;It's About Time&quot; ''[[The Drama Review]]'' v.19 n.1 (March 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; caused him to stop making dances for five years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The review was devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to understand or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions.  I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked.  When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home.  I just decided to stop making work.&lt;ref name=tdr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He continued to perform, as a member of Yvonne Rainer's company,&lt;ref name=options /&gt; and, from 1970 to 1976,&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[[Sally Banes|Banes, Sally]]. &quot;An Interview with David Gordon&quot; ''Eddy: About Dance'' (Winter 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding member of the improvisational dance group, [[Grand Union (dance group)|The Grand Union]], which evolved out of Rainer's company and included Rainer, Trisha Brown, Barbara Dilley, [[Douglas Dunn (choreographer)|Douglas Dunn]], Nancy Lewis and Steve Paxton, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon:&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent about six years in a company called The Grand Union, which was composed of six to nine artists.  All performances, which generally lasted about two hours, were totally improvised.  We didn't always know how many of us would be there or what we would be looking like, or who would leave halfway through.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gordon, David. Remarks made during the &quot;Collaboration: Investigating New Forms&quot; session at the [[Theatre Communications Group]] National Conference in June 1982.  Published in &quot;TCG Focus: Combining Forces&quot; in ''Theatre Communications'' (January 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon credits these early experiences with laying the groundwork for his artistic process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jimmy [Waring] was an education for me, as he was for most people who came in contact with him. ... [He] taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer.  From her I found out what it is to be an artist &amp;ndash; a person who makes choices and stands behind them.  Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you &amp;ndash; or led me at any rate &amp;ndash; to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it.  I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next.  I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art.  I never threw anything away.  I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, &quot;If you don't like it now, you can get to like it.  If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?&quot; The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste.  There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from [[John Cage]]'s championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In 1971 Gordon returned to making dances when Rainer put him in charge of her classes while she went to India, from which came the material which became ''Sleepwalking'',&lt;ref name=options /&gt; first performed at [[Oberlin College]] and then in New York. Gordon formed the [[Pick Up Performance Company]] that year &amp;ndash; incorporated in 1978 as a [[non-profit]] organization &amp;ndash; to support and administer his work in live performance and media. His work during this period&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.mjdc.org/CHIME/borders_gordon.html &quot;About David Gordon: Resume&quot;] on choreographer [[Margaret Jenkins]]'s website for a list of productions&lt;/ref&gt; included: 

*''The Matter'' (1972) &amp;ndash; which utilized volunteer non-dancers who had signed up at a Grand Union concert to participate in Gordon's next project;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Karen. &quot;David Gordon's ''The Matter''&quot; ''[[The Drama Review]]'' v.16 n.3 (September 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; the piece was re-mounted in 1979, with additions and subtractions as ''The Matter Plus and Minus'', and was later the inspiration for ''The Matter/2012: Art and Archive''
*''Times Four'' (1975),
*''Personal Inventory'' (1976) &amp;ndash; in which Gordon and Setterfield each had to improvise 500 different movements, counting them as they went,
*''Wordsworth and the Motor'' (1977),
*''Not Necessarily Recognizable Objectives'' (1977) &amp;ndash; for which Gordon won the first ''Soho Weekly News'' Soho Arts Award in Avant-Garde Dance,
*''What Happened'' (1978),
*''An Audience With the Pope (or This Is Where I Came In)'' (1979)

and the seminal ''Chair'' (1974), a duet for Gordon and Setterfield in which they perform with metal folding chairs,&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt; the use of which became a signature of his work.&lt;ref name=double&gt;[[Roger Copeland|Copeland, Roger]]. &quot;The Double Identity of David Gordon&quot; ''Dance Theatre Journal'' v. 13 n.2 (Autumn/Winter 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Deborah Jowitt]] wrote of his works during this period that &quot;process and polish were linked in pretty paradoxes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Jowitt|Jowitt, Deborah]]. ''Time and the Dancing Image''. Berkley, California, University of California Press, 1988. ISBN 0520066278. p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Gordon and Setterfield had a developed a reputation as &quot;the dance world's most intriguing couple.  Ideal mates, ideal opposites, yin and yang, male and female, total communication.&quot;&lt;ref name=valda /&gt; Also during this period and into the 1980s, Gordon, a natural contrarian,&lt;ref name=double /&gt; did not call himself a &quot;choreographer&quot;, but billed his pieces as being &quot;constructed&quot; by him.&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt; Although he has collaborated with visual artists and designers such as [[Powers Boothe]], [[Red Grooms]] and [[Santo Loquasto]], Gordon has often, usually without being credited for it, designed the costumes, decor and props for his pieces. In doing so, he utilizes the contents of [[thrift stores]] and makes use of mundane materials such as [[foam core]] and [[gaffers tape]]. 

Gordon's hand-made score for ''One Part of The Matter'' &amp;ndash; an excerpt from ''The Matter'' for solo dancer (Setterfield) &amp;ndash; which consisted of cut-outs of poses culled from photographs by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] taped to sheets of paper, is in the drawings collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[Museum of Modern Art]], Department of Drawings. &quot;Painters for the Theater, Drawings Gallery, July 14-October 18, 1989, Checklist&quot;  Four pages of Gordon's score were part of this exhibition, ascension numbers 127.84.a&amp;ndash;d &quot;Untitled study for the performance THE MATTER, performed by the Merce Cunningham Company, Oberlin College, Ohio and New York, 1972. (c. 1971–1972)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The score came about because Setterfield was on tour with the Cunningham company, and Gordon sent her the poses so she could memorize them in her hotel room.  When she returned, they worked together on the transitions between the poses.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; Since then, Setterfield has performed ''One Part of the Matter'' in many venues around the world.

==1980s==
In 1980, Gordon gave up his job creating window displays,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon learned the craft of display work at [[S. Klein On The Square]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] and [[Best &amp; Co.]], and for many years did the windows of the Japanese-based Azuma chain of retail stores in New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which for 18 years had supported both his work and his family &amp;ndash; his son [[Ain Gordon|Ain]] was born in 1962 &amp;ndash; to work full-time as a performer and choreographer.&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon also did other work in the visual arts.  His life-sizes collages made from torn colored no-seam paper were used as backgrounds for photographs of scientists in a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine spread, which was later published in Modell, Walter; Lansing, Alfred and the editors of [[Life (magazine)|Life]]. &quot;When Natural Defenses Fail&quot; in ''Life Science Library: Drugs''. New York: Time-Life Books, 1967, pp.102-119 except p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also appeared in two seminal documentaries about postmodern dance, ''Beyond the Mainstream: The Postmoderns'', part of the [[PBS]] ''Dance in America'' series, and [[Michael Blackwood]]'s ''Making Dances'', which focused on seven choreographers: Brown, [[Lucinda Childs]], Gordon, [[Douglas Dunn (choreographer)|Douglas Dunn]], [[Kenneth King (dancer)|Kenneth King]], [[Meredith Monk]] and [[Sara Rudner]].&lt;ref name=croce80&gt;[[Arlene Croce|Croce, Arlene]]. &quot;Dancing: Slowly Then the History of Them Comes Out&quot;. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (June 30, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelblackwoodproductions.com/md_makingdances.php &quot;Making Dances&quot;] on the Michael Blackwood Productions website&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, his Pick-Up Company toured throughout the United States, performing both intimate pieces such as:

*''Close Up'' (1979) &amp;ndash; a duet for Gordon and Setterfield &amp;ndash; and
*''Dorothy and Eileen'' (1980), in which two female dancers improvise dialogue about their mothers&lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt; &amp;ndash; which has been called &quot;[o]ne of his most successfully conceived and rendered pieces&quot;;&lt;ref name=avantauto /&gt;

as well as larger-scale works, including:

*''T.V. Reel'' (1982),
*''Trying Times'' (1982) &amp;ndash; which ends with Gordon being put on trial by his dancers,&lt;ref name=croce84 /&gt;
*''Framework'' (1983),
*''My Folks'' (1984) &amp;ndash; set to [[klezmer music]],
*''Four Men Nine Lives'' (1985),
*''Transparent Means for Travelling Light'' (1986) &amp;ndash; performed to a score by [[John Cage]],

and the mammoth ''United States'' (1988–1989), which was co-commissioned by 26 presenters in 16 states&lt;ref name=us&gt;Stamler, Gayle. &quot;'United States' comes together&quot; in ''ACUCAA Bulletin'' (October 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and has so many sections which exist in different but related versions that they have never all been performed together.  Many of Gordon's pieces from this period had their premiere at David White's [[Dance Theater Workshop]].

Gordon also made work for other companies during this time, including: 

*''Grote Ogen'' (&quot;Big Eyes&quot;) for Wekcentrum Dans in the Netherlands (1981),
*''Pas et Par'' for Theatre du Silence in Lyons (1981),
*''Counter Revolution'' (1981), ''Field Study'' (1984) and ''Bach and Offenbach'' (1986) for London's Extemporary Dance Theatre,
*''Piano Movers'' to music by [[Thelonious Monk]] for [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]] (1984),&lt;ref name=croce85&gt;[[Arlene Croce|Croce, Arlene]]. &quot;Dancing: Opus Posthumous&quot;. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (July 8, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Beethoven and Booth'' (1985) for Group Recherche Choreographique de l'Opera de Paris, and
*''Mates'' for [[Rambert Dance Company]] (1988).

He also made ''[[David Gordon (choreographer)#Field, Chair and Mountain|Field, Chair and Mountain]]'' (1985)&lt;ref name=croce85 /&gt; and ''Murder'' (1986) for [[American Ballet Theatre]] (ABT) under [[Mikhail Barishnikov]].  ''Murder'' later became part of ''David Gordon's Made in USA'', a television program commissioned by [[WNET]] and ''[[Great Performances]]'' in 1987, or which Gordon received a [[Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]].

For the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) in 1983, Gordon choreographed Act III, the dance section, of ''[[The Photographer]]'', a multi-media piece about [[Eadweard Muybridge]] with music by [[Philip Glass]], in which he incorporated Setterfield's earlier solo ''One Part of the Matter''. Also, he directed ''[[Renard (opera)|Renard]]'', a one-act chamber opera-ballet by [[Igor Stravinsky]], for the [[Spoleto Festival USA]] in 1986.

==1990s==
''The Mysteries and What's So Funny?'' (1991), in which [[Marcel Duchamp]] &amp;ndash; played by Setterfield &amp;ndash; is the central figure around which all the action swirls, received a [[Bessie Award|Bessie]] and an [[Obie Award]]. It was written, directed and choreographed by Gordon with music again by Philip Glass and visual design by [[Red Grooms]]. The script was published in ''Grove New American Theater''.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, Michael (ed.) ''Grove New American Theater'' New York: Grove Press, 1994. ISBN 0-8021-3278-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon then collaborated with his son, playwright [[Ain Gordon]], on ''The Family Business'', which premiered at [[Dance Theater Workshop]] in New York City in February 1994, received an Obie Award, and was presented at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] and at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in Los Angeles in 1995. The cast for ''The Family Business'' consisted of both Gordons, father and son, and Setterfield.

In 1994, for the [[American Repertory Theatre]] (ART) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and the [[American Music Theatre Festival]] (AMTF) in [[Philadelphia]], Gordon directed and choreographed an original [[musical theatre|musical]], ''[[Shlemiel the First (musical)|Shlemiel the First]]'', adapted by [[Robert Brustein]], from the stories of [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], and set to traditional [[klezmer]] music with new lyrics by [[Arnold Weinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Alvin Klein, writing in the ''New York Times'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Shlemiel&quot; is choreographed and directed by Mr. Gordon who, it appears, regards its eight musicians (the Klezmer Conservatory Band) as cast members in an interweaving of music and moving stage pictures, of words, spoken and sung. It can be said that Singer is the original author, Mr. Brustein is the adapter and Mr. Gordon is the auteur.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Klein, Alvin.

The show also toured throughout [[Florida]] and in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], and was re-mounted in 2010 at [[Montclair State University]]'s Alexander Kasser Theatre by Peak Performances.  This production was re-mounted by Theatre for a New Audience in Manhattan, New York City in late 2011, at [[New York University]]'s [[Skirball Center for the Performing Arts]], in association with the [[National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Gordon.

Gordon received a National Theatre Artist Residency Grant, funded by the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] and administered by [[Theatre Communications Group]], to work with the [[Guthrie Theater]] in [[Minneapolis]], where he directed and choreographed ''[[The Firebugs]]'' by [[Max Frisch]] for their mainstage in 1995. 

Ain and David Gordon collaborated again on the book and direction for ''Punch &amp; Judy Get Divorced'', with music by [[Edward Barnes (composer)|Edward Barnes]] and lyrics by [[Arnold Weinstein]], which premiered at AMTF in 1996 and was subsequently presented by ART. The piece began in 1991 as a one-act television program made for [[KTCA]] for their [[PBS]] series ''[[Alive TV]]'', and had a second life as a dance piece, set to music by [[Carl Stalling]], for Barishnikov's [[White Oak Dance Project]] in 1992.  In 1999, the Gordons worked together once more, this time on a musical about women directors in the early days of motion pictures, ''[[David Gordon (choreographer)#The First Picture Show|The First Picture Show]]'', with music by [[Jeanine Tesori]], for ACT in San Francisco and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

==2000s and 2010s==
Other productions Gordon has created as writer, director and choreographer include ''Autobiography of a Liar'' (1999), ''FAMILY$DEATH@ART.COMedy'' (2001) &amp;ndash; for which he received his third Bessie Award&lt;ref name=kourlas2002 /&gt; &amp;ndash; and ''Private Lives of Dancers'' (2002), all originally presented at [[Danspace Project|Danspace]] in New York.  In 2000, he was commissioned by ACT to write an adaptation of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', with music by [[Gina Leishman]], which was called ''Some Kind of Wind in the Willows''.  This production was workshopped but was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ginaleishman.com/ginaleishman/listen_willows.html  &quot;Some Kind of Wind in the Willows&quot;] on GinaLeishman.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year, he assembled and directed for White Oak a retrospective program of postmodern dance, ''Past/Forward'', which included pieces by Gordon, [[Simone Forti]], Steve Paxton, [[Deborah Hay]], Yvonne Rainer, Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Lynn. &quot;Bodies of History and Historical Bodies: Baryshnikov and the Judson Legacy: White Oak at Gammage Auditorium, Tempe, Arizona, October 15, 2000&quot; in ''PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art'' (Volume 23, Number 3), September 2001, pp. 13-19, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/paj/v023/23.3houston.pdf abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Gordon made ''[[David Gordon (choreographer)#Dancing Henry Five|Dancing Henry Five]]'', which utilized [[William Walton]]'s music for [[Laurence Olivier]]'s film of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', as well as dialogue from the film and recorded dramatic recitations of the text by [[Christopher Plummer]] and others.  This production received an American Masterpiece Grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Dance Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/10grants/am10.php?disc=Dance &quot;FY 2010 Grant Awards: American Masterpieces: Dance&quot;] on the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and has been seen in New York, [[Walker Arts Center|Minneapolis]], [[Lawrence, Kansas]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and [[ODC/Dance|ODC]] in San Francisco.  In 2011 it was revived and performed at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]] in Chicago and the [[University of Albany]], New York.

Gordon has also adapted, directed and choreographed a number of classic theatre works:

*[[Eugene Ionesco]]'s ''[[The Chairs]]'' (2004, presented in [[London]], [[Seattle]] and at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York City) &amp;ndash; in which he and Setterfield played the Old Man and the Old Woman to a solo [[cello]] score composed by [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]] (no relative);
*''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' (2004, for Theatre for a New Audience in New York);
*[[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' (2006, as ''Aristophanes in Birdonia'');
*''[[Round Heads and Pointed Heads|The Roundheads and the Pointheads]]'' by [[Bertholt Brecht]] with music by [[Hanns Eisler]] (2002&amp;ndash;2009, as ''Uncivil Wars: Moving with Brecht and Eisler'', commissioned by the [[Walker Arts Center]] in Minneapolis and [[The Kitchen]] in New York City), and also performed at [[Montclair State University]].  The piece was workshopped at [[Cornell University]].
*[[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', plus two other short pieces by the writer, became the basis of Gordon's ''Beginning of the End of the...'', which played for the month of June 2012 at the [[Joyce Theatre|Joyce SoHo]].&lt;ref&gt;La Rocco, Claudia [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/arts/dance/beginning-of-the-end-of-the-at-joyce-soho.html &quot;Art, Life and Death, Inexplicably Intertwined&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'' (June 7, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Gordon mounted for [[Danspace Project]] ''The Matter/2012: Art and Archive'', based on his early work ''The Matter'' (1972/1979), and including versions of ''Mannequin'' (1962) and ''Chair'' (1974).  The piece was part of the series ''Platform 2012: Judson Now'', connected to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first [[Judson Dance Theater]] performances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danspaceproject.org/calendarandtickets/detail.php?id=176 &quot;''The Matter/2012''&quot;] on the [[Danspace Project]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and was called by the ''[[New York Times]]'' &quot;a breathtaking evening of dance that pays homage to his early days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kourlas, Gia. [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/arts/dance/the-matter-2012-by-david-gordon-at-danspace-project.html &quot;The Old Is New Again, as the Muse Endures&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' (October 27, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Gordon was named as one of 20 artists who received a Doris Duke Artist Award from the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]], an  unrestricted multi-year award of $225,000 plus additional amounts for audience development and &quot;personal reserves or creative exploration during what are commonly retirement years for most Americans&quot;.&lt;ref name=dukeartist /&gt;

==Reception==
{{anchor|Field, Chair and Mountain}} Gordon's work has been generally well received by the critics and the public, although his piece ''Field, Chair and Mountain'' for American Ballet Theater, his first ballet, was reportedly booed at its premiere at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center Opera House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Suzanne. &quot;ABT's Vandalized 'Chair'&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'' (c.January 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanna. William John. &quot;It Was I&quot; (Letter to the editor). ''[[Washington Post]]'' (January 5, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The critical response was more generous, calling it &quot;remarkable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Zakariasen, Bill. &quot;Remarkable debut show from ABT&quot; ''[[New York Daily News]]'' (May 3, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;irreverent and clever&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Tobias, Tobi. &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' (May 13, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;a mesmerizing exploration of partnering&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Martha. &quot;Smiles of a Winter Night&quot; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (February 25, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;one of the most beautiful and distinctive [ballets] in ABT's current repertory&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Laura. &quot;The Turning Point&quot; ''[[Newsweek]]'' (February 25, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and praising Gordon's &quot;deadpan humor and ... obvious nostalgic affection for things romantic&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Laurie. &quot;ABT opens season with humor, romance&quot;.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (March 7, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Arlene Croce]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said that the ballet was &quot;the kind of folly that advances to the limit of frivolity on the strength of passion,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arlene Croce|Croce, Arlene]]. &quot;Dancing: Experiments&quot; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (January 28, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Anna Kisselgoff]] wrote that &quot;Despite [its] original aspects, &quot;Field, Chair and Mountain&quot; does not add up to anything beyond its isolated parts.  Mr. Gordon's ideas seem dressed up in opera-house trappings that hang like ill-fitting clothes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kisselgoff, Anna. &quot;Ballet Theater: A New Work by David Gordon&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'' (April 29, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Dancing Henry Five}} Twenty years later, Gordon, who had not previously considered himself to be a political artist, created ''Dancing Henry Five'' in response to the [[9/11 attacks]] and the [[War in Iraq (2003)|war in Iraq]].&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;Kaufman, Sarah. &quot;Positions of Power&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'' (May 14, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  It also received mostly positive critical response.  It was called &quot;a bare-bones production that created a powerful epic mood&quot; by [[John Rockwell]], who compared it favorably to a production of ''[[Henry IV]]'' at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rockwell|Rockwell, John]].

{{anchor|The First Picture Show}} However, several years prior to the success of ''Dancing Henry Five'', Gordon collaborated with [[Ain Gordon]] and composer [[Jeanine Tesori]] on the stage musical ''The First Picture Show'', about female directors in the early days of the movie business, which starred [[Estelle Parsons]] and [[Ellen Greene]].  The piece was extensively workshopped and performed in San Francisco, at the [[American Conservatory Theatre]], and in Los Angeles at the [[Mark Taper Forum]], which had commissioned the piece. After the success of ''[[Shlemiel the First (musical)|Shlemiel the First]]'' in L.A. several years before, expectations were high for the new musical, but the critical reception was not overly positive &amp;ndash; the critic for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: &quot;This tantalizing if unformed project has too vital a subject, or subjects, for mere nostalgia. Occasionally wonderful and never dull, 'The First Picture Show' lacks a certain urgency in its storytelling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/13/entertainment/ca-65193 &quot;When Silent Was Golden&quot;] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (August 13, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and the production had no commercial transfer after its subscription run.  Some years later, in response to a question about whether his career had ever &quot;hit the wall&quot;, Gordon said: &quot;I died in L.A.&quot;, but acknowledges that he then &quot;came back to New York and began again, choreographing for my own company.&quot;&lt;ref name=fail&gt;Kourlas, Gia. &quot;'I'm always thinking I've failed'&quot; ''[[Time Out New York]]'' (July 24–30, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the results of starting over was ''Dancing Henry Five.''

==Analysis and interpretation==
Throughout his career, critics have encapsulated Gordon and his work:

*&lt;blockquote&gt;Gordon wants to sensitize the spectator to a shifting dialectic between the individual gesture and the larger choreographic structure in which it is embedded. Rather than highlighting the individual gesture as such, Gordon playfully investigates the ways in which a discreet movement in a dance phrase will change in terms of how we perceive it as a result of the position it occupies in systematically varied choreographic complexes. ([[Noël Carroll]], 1978) &lt;ref&gt;[[Noël Carroll|Carroll, Noël]]. &quot;Formal Dancing&quot; ''Soho Weekly News'' (October 12, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;[Gordon] has been labelled a formalist, a structuralist, a master wordsmith, an avant-garde comedian, a satirist, a reflexive parodist.  His works are profound investigations of correspondances and collisions between language and movement, examinations of the creative and performing processes, explorations of structures. They are also enormously ''likable'' and often delightfully humorous. ([[Amanda Smith]], 1981) &lt;ref name=options&gt;[[Amanda Smith|Smith, Amanda]]. &quot;David Gordon: Keeping the Options Open&quot; ''[[Dancemagazine]]'' (February 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;In David Gordon's dances, simple movement phrases are reiterated until what you notice is not the movement itself but the distinctiveness of the bodies of the performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so that what you want to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing. ([[Sally Banes]], 1981) &lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Banes|Banes, Sally]]. &quot;Icon and Image in New Dance&quot; in ''New Dance USA'' (festival catalogue) Minneapolis: [[Walker Arts Center]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;[L]ongtime observers of Gordon's work would be hard pressed to find a better definition of it than one vast game that he plays with Valda Setterfield.  His sense of irony has been bouncing off her level, unassuming façade for years.  Since she is always perfectly straight, Gordon's own gift for projecting comic ambiguity in language and movement can shine all the brighter, with an innocence beyond stain.  It may be that without Setterfield as chief sounding board and accomplice he would not have developed his double edge at all &amp;ndash; at least, not into the guileless satirical instrument it is now. ([[Arlene Croce]], 1982) &lt;ref name=croce82 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;What [Gordon] is, I think, is a plasario punographer: playwright/impresario/punster/choreographer. He's also the dance world's leading humanist. His work has a warmth, a glow, a wry humor and an all-encompassing love for life.  The quirks, foibles and impossible complexities of our urban environment are seen and shown as both invigorating and consoling, frustrating and stimulating. (Allen Robertson, 1982) &lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Allen. &quot;Clever Cookie&quot; ''Ballet News'' (March 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;Formed by the polemical 1960s, Gordon seems to be, by nature, an ironist, with an appreciation of paradox, a fascination with the psychology of partnering, an ambivalence about glamour and fame.  On occasion he has revealed a critical temperament and, in postmodern (or Balanchinian) fashion, an interest in layered allusions.  He also husbands themes and effects. ([[Mindy Aloff]], 1985) &lt;ref&gt;[[Mindy Aloff|Aloff, Mindy]]. &quot;Dance: Field, Chair and Mountain; Einstein on the Beach&quot; ''[[The Nation (magazine)|The Nation]]'' (February 16, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;Gordon is a true contrarian; he always seems to work against the grain. ... The mythology of [the [[Judson Dance Theatre]]] often equates the entire era with [[Yvonne Rainer#No Manifesto|Yvonne Rainer's manifesto of renunciation]]. ... No to transformations and magic?  Not for David Gordon. (Although it's essential to point out that his attitude toward transformation and magic has more in common with the work of hip, anti-illusionistic conjurors like [[Penn and Teller]] than with the overproduced, mysterioso/glitz of [[David Copperfield (magician)|David Copperfield]].) Gordon is the sort of magician who shows you where the rabbit is hiding in the hat. ...  [H]e isn't the first choreographer to make a major contribution to the theatre. ... But Gordon ''is'' the first &quot;dance person&quot; who's as much a playwright as a choreographer. ([[Roger Copeland]], 1996) &lt;ref name=double /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;David Gordon is no ordinary choreographer,  He understands how to manipulate text and dance so that the result evokes an invigorating place, where thoughtful theater takes on the appearance of being casual. It never is just that. ... [He] plays with many pieces of seemingly disparate phrases before they are transformed into an eloquent whole.  In many ways, he is a gleaner of his own work, which he files away with the possibility of revisiting it in the future. ... But as much as he revives material after recontextualizing it, most fundamental to the vitality of [his] repertory is not what the movement looks like or even what the words say, but the beguiling way in which they fit together.  He is a director who knows dance.  And even though there is a bit of everything in his work &amp;ndash; humor, musicality, lush movement &amp;ndash; he is unpredictable. (Gia Kourlas, 2002) &lt;ref name=kourlas2002&gt;Kourlas, Gia. &quot;Rehearsing for Dance And for Life&quot;. ''[[New York Times]]'' (January 6, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Sinise's name was in an advertisement in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (August 17, 2006) that condemned [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] and supported [[Israel]] in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.hollywoodgrind.com/nicole-kidman-and-84-others-stand-united-against-terrorism/ Nicole Kidman and 84 Others Stand United Against Terrorism]&quot; ''Hollywood Grind''.

In June 2008, Sinise donated $2,300 to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Presidential [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|primary campaign]] of [[Arizona]] Senator [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Gary_Sinise.php |title=Gary Sinise's Federal Campaign Contribution Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolle Wallace, a former adviser to George W. Bush and the presidential campaign of John McCain, stated in May 2009 that she believed Sinise could help bring about a resurgence of the Republican Party. Wallace stated, &quot;The natural strengths that an actor brings to politics would come in handy to anyone going up against Obama in 2012. We will need an effective communicator who can stand toe to toe with Obama’s eloquence.&quot; Other names mentioned were those of Generals [[David Petraeus]] and [[Ray Odierno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/11/actor-gary-sinise-floated-as-possible-gop-savior/ |title=Actor Gary Sinise floated as possible GOP savior |publisher=CNN | date=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinise narrates the online virtual tour for the Ronald Reagan Presidential library and spoke at the centennial celebration of Reagan's birth at the library in February 2011.

'''Nancy Marchand''' (June 19, 1928 – June 18, 2000) was an American actress, whose career encompassed both [[theatre|stage]] and [[film|screen]]. Standing almost 6 feet tall, she began her career in theatre in 1951. She was perhaps most famous for her television portrayals of Margaret Pynchon on ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' and [[Livia Soprano]] on ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

==Early years==
Marchand was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Raymond L. Marchand, a physician, and his wife, Marjorie Freeman, a pianist. She was raised Methodist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nancy Marchand|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Nancy-Marchand.html |work=FilmReference |year=2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A member of [[Actors Studio|The Actors Studio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=279|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marchand made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' in 1951. Additional theatre credits include ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[Forty Carats]]'', ''[[And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little]]'', ''[[The Plough and the Stars]]'', ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', ''[[Morning's at Seven]]'', ''[[Awake and Sing!]]'', ''[[The Octette Bridge Club]]'', ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'', ''[[Man and Superman]]'', ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', ''[[The Balcony]]'', for which she won a Distinguished Performance [[Obie Award]], and ''[[Black Comedy/White Lies]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play]]. She was nominated four times for the [[Drama Desk Award]], winning for ''Morning's at Seven''. She won a second Obie for her performance in [[A. R. Gurney]]'s ''[[The Cocktail Hour]]''.

===Television===
On daytime television, Marchand created the roles of Vinnie Phillips on the [[CBS]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Love of Life]]'' and Theresa Lamonte on the [[NBC]] soap, ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''. She also starred as matriarch, Edith Cushing, on ''[[Lovers and Friends]]'', a short-lived soap opera.  

On prime time television, Marchand was known for her roles of autocratic newspaper publisher Margaret Pynchon on ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''—winning four [[Emmy Award]]s as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series]] for her performance —and matriarch [[Livia Soprano]], mother of [[Tony Soprano]], on the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]'', which earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]]. She appeared in many [[anthology series]] in the early days of television, including ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]]'' (on which she starred in ''[[Marty]]'' opposite [[Rod Steiger]]), ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Studio One (TV series)|Studio One]]'', and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''. Additional television credits include ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'', ''[[Spenser: For Hire]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', and ''[[Night Court]]''. She played [[Hester Crane]], mother of [[Frasier Crane]], on an episode of ''[[Cheers]]''.

==Films==
Marchand's [[feature film]] credits include ''[[Ladybug Ladybug (film)|Ladybug Ladybug]]'', ''[[Me, Natalie]]'', ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]'', ''[[The Hospital]]'', ''[[The Bostonians (film)|The Bostonians]]'', ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'', ''[[The Bachelor Party]](1957 film), ''[[Brain Donors]]'', ''[[Reckless (1995 film)|Reckless]]'', ''[[The Naked Gun]]'', ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'', ''[[Dear God (film)|Dear God]]'', and ''From the Hip'' (1986 film).

==Later life and death==
At 70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of Caligula's great-grandmother in ''I, Claudius,'' a woman who also happened to be named Livia. Nancy died from [[lung cancer]] and [[emphysema]] on 18 June 2000, the day before what would have been her 72nd birthday in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. As a result, her character's death was written into the third season story line of ''The Sopranos''. Her husband of 48 years, actor [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0816926 Paul Sparer (1923–1999)], had died the previous year, also from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0816926 Paul Sparer profile at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children, Katie, an actress who lives in Stratford; David (Rosebud) a lawyer, of Madison, Wis.; and Rachel Sparer Bersier, an opera singer of Manhattan.

'''Robert &quot;Cal&quot; Traill Spence Lowell IV''' (March 1, 1917 – September 12, 1977) was an American poet. He was born into a [[Boston Brahmin]] family that could trace its origins back to the ''[[Mayflower]]'', and his family, past and present, were important subjects in his poetry. Growing up in [[Boston]] also informed his poems, which were frequently set in Boston and the New England region.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Ian. Robert Lowell: A Biography, Faber &amp; Faber, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the publication of his 1959 book ''[[Life Studies]]'', which won the 1960 [[National Book Award]] and &quot;featured a new emphasis on intense, uninhibited discussion of personal, family, and psychological struggles,&quot; he was considered an important part of the [[confessional poet]]ry movement.&lt;ref&gt;National Book Award Website[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1960.html &quot;National Book Awards – 1960&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated251&quot;&gt;&quot;Robert Lowell (1917-1977).&quot; ''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Jeffrey W. Hunter. Vol. 124. Detroit: Gale Group, 2000. p251-308.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of Lowell's work, which often combined the public with the personal, did not conform to a typical &quot;confessional poetry&quot; model. Instead, Lowell worked in a number of distinctive stylistic modes and forms over the course of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated251&quot;/&gt;

He was appointed the sixth [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], where he served from 1947 until 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;poetryfoundation.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/robert-lowell |title=Robert Lowell |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1953-1960 | url=http://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | accessdate=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In additional to winning the National Book Award, he won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947 and 1974, the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1977, and a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1947. He is &quot;widely considered one of the most important American poets of the postwar era.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated251&quot;/&gt;

==Life==

===Family history===
Lowell was born to [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Robert Traill Spencer Lowell III and Charlotte (née Winslow) in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. The [[Lowell family|Lowells]] were a [[Boston Brahmin]] family that included poets [[Amy Lowell]] and [[James Russell Lowell]]; clergymen [[Charles Russell Lowell, Sr.]] and [[Robert Traill Spence Lowell]]; [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general and war hero [[Charles Russell Lowell]] (whom Lowell wrote about in his poem &quot;Charles Russell Lowell: 1835-1864&quot;); and the Federal Judge [[John Lowell]]. 

His mother was a descendant of [[William Samuel Johnson]], a signer of the [[United States Constitution]]; [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the [[Calvinist]] theologian (whom Lowell wrote about in his poems &quot;Mr. Edwards and the Spider,&quot; &quot;Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts,&quot; &quot;After the Surprising Conversions,&quot; and &quot;The Worst Sinner&quot;); [[Anne Hutchinson]], the [[Puritan]] preacher and healer; [[Robert Livingston the Elder]] (who was also an ancestor on Lowell's paternal side); [[Thomas Dudley]], the second governor of Massachusetts; and ''[[Mayflower]]'' passengers [[James Chilton]] and his daughter [[Mary Chilton]]. Lowell's parents share a common descent from [[Philip Livingston (1686–1749)|Philip Livingston]], the son of Robert Livingston the Elder, which means they were sixth cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, N., 'Charlotte Winslow and Commander Robert Traill Spence Lowell III - Relationship Chart'[http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/relationship.php?path_to_find=-1&amp;pid1=I6548&amp;show_full=1&amp;showfull=0&amp;pid2=I6549&amp;pretty=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as a family history steeped in [[Protestantism]], Lowell had notable [[Jews|Jewish]] ancestors on both sides of his family,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins2010&quot;&gt;[http://arcade.stanford.edu/beyond-wikipedia-notes-robert-lowells-family&quot;Beyond Wikipedia: Notes on Robert Lowell's Family&quot;.] ''Nicholas Jenkins: Arcade''. May 07, 2010.   Accessed November 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which he discusses in Part II (&quot;91 Revere Street&quot;) of ''[[Life Studies]]''. On his father's side, Lowell was the great-great-grandson of Maj. Mordecai Myers (father of [[Theodorus Bailey Myers]], Lowell's great-granduncle), a soldier in the [[War of 1812]] and later Mayor of [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook]] and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyhumanities.org/speakers/adult_audiences/lecture.php?lecture_id=1358 New York Council of Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; and on his mother's side, he is descended from the [[Mordecai House|Mordecai]] family of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], who were prominent in state affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2002/02/25/29683.html&quot;Myer Myers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York&quot;.] ''absolutearts.com''. May 26, 2005.   Accessed November 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
As a youth, Lowell had a penchant for violence and bullying other children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, Ian 1982&quot;&gt;Hamilton, Ian. Robert Lowell: A Biography, Faber &amp; Faber, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Lowell's peers gave him the nickname &quot;Cal&quot; after the tyrannical Roman emperor [[Caligula]], and the nickname stuck with him throughout his life. Lowell would later reference the nickname in his poem &quot;Caligula,&quot; first published in his book ''[[For the Union Dead]]'' and later republished in a revised sonnet version for his book ''Notebook 1967-1968''. 

Lowell received his high school education at [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], a prominent prep-school in Southborough, Massachusetts, where he met and was influenced by the poet [[Richard Eberhart]] who taught at the school. It was in high school that Lowell decided that he wanted to become a poet. After high school, he attended [[Harvard College]] for two years. While he was a freshman at Harvard, he visited [[Robert Frost]] in Cambridge and asked for feedback on a long poem he'd written on the Crusades; Frost suggested that he needed to work on his compression. In an interview, Lowell recalled, &quot;I had a huge blank verse epic on the First Crusade and took it to him all in my uncipherable pencil-writing, and he read a little of it, and said, 'It goes on rather a bit, doesn't it?' And then he read me the opening of [[John Keats|Keats's]] 'Hyperion,' the first version, and I thought all of that was sublime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth and Robert Penn Warren. &quot;Robert Lowell.&quot; ''Conversations on the Craft of Poetry''. New York: Hold, Rinehart, and Winston, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, Lowell transferred to [[Kenyon College]] in Gambier, Ohio, to study under [[John Crowe Ransom]] and [[Allen Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/r_lowell.php Robert Lowell] Poets of Cambridge, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

Before arriving at Kenyon, Lowell asked Allen Tate if he could live with him, and Tate joked that if Lowell wanted to, he could pitch a tent on his lawn; this is exactly what Lowell did. In an interview for ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Lowell stated that he went to [[Sears, Roebuck]] to purchase the &quot;pup tent&quot; that he set up on Tate's lawn and lived in for two months.&lt;ref&gt;Voices and Visions Series on Lowell - http://www.learner.org/resources/series57.html?pop=yes&amp;pid=601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theparisreview.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Interviewed by Frederick Seidel |url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4664/the-art-of-poetry-no-3-robert-lowell |title=The Art of Poetry No. 3, Robert Lowell |publisher=Paris Review |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lowell called the act &quot;a terrible piece of youthful callousness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theparisreview.org&quot;/&gt; Fortunately for Tate and his wife, Lowell soon settled into the so-called &quot;writer's house&quot; (a dorm that received its nickname after it had accrued a number of ambitious young writers) with fellow students [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]] and [[Randall Jarrell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/4337918 McAlexander, Hugh, &quot;Peter Taylor: The Undergraduate Years at Kenyon,&quot; ''The Kenyon Review,'' New Series, Vol. 21, No. 3/4 (Summer - Autumn, 1999), pp. 43-57.]&lt;/ref&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly in rebellion against his parents, he converted from Episcopalianism to Catholicism (however, by the end of the forties, he would end up leaving the Catholic Church).&lt;ref name=&quot;poets&quot;&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/10 Robert Lowell @ Poets.org]&lt;/ref&gt; After Lowell graduated from Kenyon in 1940 with a degree in Classics, he worked on a Masters degree in English literature at [[Louisiana State University]] for one year before the United States entered World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lowell/bio.htm U of Illinois - Robert Lowell Bio Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
Lowell was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Draft Dodgers and Dissenters,&quot; ''Time Magazine,'' November 14, 1943, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; and served several months at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury|federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut]]. He explained his decision not to serve in World War II in a letter addressed to President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] on September 7, 1943, stating, &quot;Dear Mr President: I very much regret that I must refuse the opportunity you offer me in your communication of August 6, 1943 for service in the Armed Force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dialoginternational.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialoginternational.com/dialog_international/2008/08/robert-lowells.html |title=Robert Lowell's Letter to FDR |publisher=Dialog International |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, he goes on to explain that after the bombing at [[Pearl Harbor]], he was prepared to fight in the war until he read about the United States' terms of [[unconditional surrender]] which he feared would lead to the &quot;permanent destruction of Germany and Japan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dialoginternational.com&quot;/&gt; Before Lowell was transferred to the prison in Connecticut, he was held in a prison in New York City which he later wrote about in the poem &quot;Memories of West Street and Lepke&quot; from his book ''Life Studies''.

===Influence===
From 1950 to 1953, Lowell taught in the well-reputed [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], together with [[Paul Engle]], Robie Macauley, and [[Anthony Hecht]].&lt;ref name=&quot;poetryfoundation.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OwhMQZD3c7oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=9780826210296&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bellamy, Joe David ''Literary luxuries: American writing at the end of the millennium,'' University of Missouri Press, 1995 ISBN 978-0-8262-1029-6, p. 113.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Anthony Hecht, ''The Harvard Bulletin'', Volume 75, 1972, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, [[Donald James Winslow]] hired Lowell to teach at [[Boston University]], where his students included the poets [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[Anne Sexton]].&lt;ref name=Marquard2010&gt;{{cite journal

''Robert Lowell: Interviews and Memoirs.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Spivack also published a book, ''With Robert Lowell and His Circle'' (2012), about her experience studying with Lowell at Boston University in 1959.

In a 1962 interview with Peter Orr, Sylvia Plath specifically cited Lowell's book ''Life Studies'' as having had a profound influence over the poetry she was writing at that time (and which her husband, [[Ted Hughes]], would publish posthumously as ''[[Ariel (book)|Ariel]]'' a few years later), stating, &quot;I've been very excited by what I feel is the new breakthrough that came with, say, Robert Lowell's ''Life Studies'', this intense breakthrough into very serious, very personal, emotional experience which I feel has been partly taboo. Robert Lowell's poems about his experience in a mental hospital, for example, interested me very much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Peter, ed.

In March 2005, the [[Academy of American Poets]] named ''Life Studies'' one of their ''Groundbreaking Books'' of the 20th century, stating that it had &quot;a profound impact,&quot; particularly over the [[confessional poetry]] movement which the book helped launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5960 Poets.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpublisher.com/article.php?page=1048 Independent Publisher article on Groundbreaking Books feature]&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay published in 1985, the poet [[Stanley Kunitz]] wrote that ''Life Studies'' was &quot;perhaps the most influential book of modern verse since [[T.S. Eliot|T. S. Eliot's]] ''[[The Waste Land]].''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kunitz, Stanley 1985&quot;&gt;Kunitz, Stanley. ''Next-to-Last Things: New Poems and Essays''. Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s Lowell was active in the [[civil rights movement]] and opposed the US involvement in [[Vietnam]].  His participation in the October 1967 peace march in [[Washington, DC]] and his subsequent arrest would be described in the early sections of [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Armies of the Night]]''. In that book, Mailer wrote, &quot;[Lowell spoke] in his fine stammering voice which gave the impression that life rushed at him in a series of hurdles and some he succeeded in jumping and some he did not.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;all flaws considered, Lowell was still a fine, good, and honorable man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mailer, Norman. The Armies of the Night. New York: New American Library, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Lowell stated, &quot;The poets who most directly influenced me ... were Allen Tate, [[Elizabeth Bishop]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]. An unlikely combination! ... but you can see that Bishop is a sort of bridge between Tate's formalism and Williams's informal art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Kunitz|Kunitz, Stanley]]. &quot;Talk with Robert Lowell.&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]''.

By 1967, he was the most public, well-known American poet; in June, he appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as part of a lengthy cover story on American poetry in which he was praised as &quot;the best American poet of his generation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19670602,00.html Time Cover]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Poets: A Second Chance.&quot; No Author listed. Time Magazine. June 2, 1967. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902090-1,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the article gave a general overview of modern American poetry (mentioning Lowell's contemporaries like [[John Berryman]] and Elizabeth Bishop), Lowell's life, career, and place in the American [[literary canon]] remained the article's focus.

===Relationships===
Lowell married the novelist [[Jean Stafford]] in 1940. Before their marriage, in 1938, Lowell and Stafford got into a serious car accident, in which Lowell was at the wheel, that left Stafford permanently scarred, while Lowell walked away unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Stafford,Jean.html |title=Jean Stafford - Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Accuracyproject.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a tumultuous marriage that ended in 1948. The poet Anthony Hecht characterized the marriage as &quot;a tormented and tormenting one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Voices and Visions Video Series. ''Robert Lowell''. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, shortly thereafter, in 1949 Lowell married the writer [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] with whom he had a daughter, Harriet, in 1957. Later, the press would characterize their marriage as &quot;restless and emotionally harrowing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher. &quot;Elizabeth Hardwick, Writer, Dies at 91. ''The New York Times''. December 4, 2007. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/obituaries/04cnd-hardwick.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt; After 23 years of marriage to Elizabeth Hardwick, in 1970, Lowell left her for the British author Lady [[Caroline Blackwood]]. Blackwood and Lowell were married in 1972 in England where they decided to settle and where they raised their son, Sheridan. Lowell also became the stepfather to Blackwood's young daughter, Ivana, for whom he would write the sonnet &quot;Ivana,&quot; published in his book ''The Dolphin''. 

Lowell had a close friendship with the poet Elizabeth Bishop that lasted from 1947 until Lowell's death in 1977. Both writers relied upon one another for critiques of their poetry (which is in evidence in their voluminous correspondence, published in the book ''Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell'' in 2008) and thereby influenced one another's work.&lt;ref&gt;''Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence Between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell''. Ed. Thomas Travisano and Saskia Hamilton. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop's influence over Lowell can be seen at work in at least two of Lowell's poems: &quot;The Scream&quot; (inspired by Bishop's short story &quot;In the Village&quot;) and &quot;[[Skunk Hour]]&quot; (inspired by Bishop's poem &quot;The Armadillo&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Robert. ''Collected Poems''. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Robert. ''Collected Prose''. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowell also maintained a close friendship with the previously mentioned poet/critic Randall Jarrell from the time when they met at Kenyon College in 1937 until Jarrell's death in 1965. Lowell openly acknowledged Jarrell's influence over his writing and frequently sought out Jarrell's input regarding his poems before he published them. In a letter to Jarrell from 1957, Lowell wrote, &quot;I suppose we shouldn't swap too many compliments, but I am heavily in your debt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Robert. Letters. &quot;To Randall Jarrell.&quot; October 11, 1957. NY: FS&amp;G, 2005. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
Lowell suffered from [[manic depression]] and was hospitalized many times throughout his adult life for this mental illness.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Vendler&quot;&gt;[http://media.nybooks.com/110308-vendler.mp3 Helen Vendler phone interview on Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop] audio podcast from ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Accessed September 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although his manic depression was often a great burden (for himself and his family), the subject of that mental illness led to some of his most important poetry, particularly as it manifested itself in his book ''Life Studies''. When he was fifty, Lowell began taking [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] to treat his mental illness. The editor of Lowell's ''Letters'', [[Saskia Hamilton]] notes, &quot;Lithium treatment relieved him from suffering the idea that he was morally and emotionally responsible for the fact that he relapsed. However, it did not entirely prevent relapses ... And he was troubled and anxious about the impact of his relapses on his family and friends until the end of his life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Saskia. &quot;Introduction: 'I Was Naked Without My Line-Ends.'&quot; ''The Letters of Robert Lowell''. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowell died in 1977, having suffered a heart attack in a cab in New York City on his way to see his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick. He was buried in Stark Cemetery, [[Dunbarton, New Hampshire]].

===1940s===
Lowell's first book of poems, ''[[Land of Unlikeness]]'' (1944), did not receive much attention. However, in 1946, Lowell received wide acclaim for his next book, ''[[Lord Weary's Castle]]'', which included five poems slightly revised from ''Land of Unlikeness'', plus thirty new poems.  Among the better known poems in the volume are &quot;Mr Edwards and the Spider&quot; and &quot;[[The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket]].&quot; ''Lord Weary's Castle'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947. That year, Lowell also was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated251&quot;/&gt;

Randall Jarrell gave ''Lord Weary's Castle'' high praise, writing, &quot;It is unusually difficult to say which are the best poems in ''Lord Weary's Castle'': several are realized past changing, successes that vary only in scope and intensity--others are poems that almost any living poet would be pleased to have written ... [and] one or two of these poems, I think, will be read as long as men remember English.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. &quot;From the Kingdom of Necessity.&quot; ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowell's early poems were formal, ornate, and concerned with violence and theology; a typical example is the close of &quot;The Quaker Graveyard&quot; -- &quot;You could cut the brackish winds with a knife / Here in Nantucket and cast up the time / When the Lord God formed man from the sea's slime / And breathed into his face the breath of life, / And the blue-lung'd combers lumbered to the kill. / The Lord survives the rainbow of His will.&quot; He was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1947−1948 (a position now known as the U.S. [[Poet Laureate]]).

===1950s===
In 1950, Lowell was included in the influential anthology ''Mid-Century American Poets'' as one of the key literary figures of his generation. Among his contemporaries who also appeared in that book were [[Muriel Rukeyser]], [[Karl Shapiro]], Elizabeth Bishop, [[Theodore Roethke]], Randall Jarrell, and [[John Ciardi]], all poets who came into prominence in the 1940s. 

In 1951, Lowell published ''[[The Mills of the Kavanaughs]]'' which centered on its epic title poem and failed to receive the high praise that his previous book had received. Following the mixed response&lt;ref&gt;Poore, Charles. &quot;Books of the Times.&quot; The New York Times. 12 May 1951. p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. &quot;A View of Three Poets.&quot; ''Partisan Review''. November/December 1951, 696.&lt;/ref&gt; to the book, Lowell hit a creative roadblock and took a long break from publishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, Ian 1982&quot;/&gt; However, by the end of the decade, he started writing again and was able to revive his reputation with ''Life Studies'' (1959) which won the [[National Book Award]] for poetry in 1960 and became the most influential book that Lowell would ever publish.&lt;ref name=nba1960&gt;

No author listed]&lt;/ref&gt; In his acceptance speech for the National Book Award, Lowell famously divided American poetry into two camps: the &quot;cooked&quot; and the &quot;raw.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_rlowell.html |title=Robert Lowell accepts the 1960 National Book Award for Poetry for Life Studies, The National Book Foundation |publisher=Nationalbook.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commentary by Lowell was made in reference to the popularity of [[Allen Ginsberg]] and the [[Beat Generation]] poets and was a signal from Lowell that he was trying to incorporate some of their &quot;raw&quot; energy into his own poetry.

The poems in ''Life Studies'' were written in a mix of free and metered verse, with much more informal language than he had used in his first three books. It marked both a big turning point in Lowell's career, and a turning point for [[American poetry]] in general.  Because many of the poems documented details from Lowell's family life and personal problems, one critic, M.L. Rosenthal, labeled these poems &quot;confessional.&quot; Lowell's editor and friend [[Frank Bidart]] notes in his afterword to Lowell's ''Collected Poems,'' &quot;Lowell is widely, perhaps indelibly associated with the term 'confessional,'&quot; though Bidart questions the accuracy of this label.&lt;ref&gt;Bidart, Frank, editor. (2003) &quot;On Confessional Poetry.&quot; ''Robert Lowell Collected Poems''. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux&lt;/ref&gt;  But for better or worse, this label stuck and led to Lowell being grouped together with other influential [[confessional poets]] like Lowell's former students [[W. D. Snodgrass]], Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton.

===1960s===
Lowell followed ''Life Studies'' with ''Imitations'' (1961), a volume of loose translations of poems by classical and modern European poets, including [[Rilke]], [[Montale]], [[Baudelaire]], [[Pasternak]], and [[Rimbaud]], for which he received the 1962 Bollingen Poetry Translation Prize. However, critical response to ''Imitations'' was mixed and sometimes hostile (as was the case with [[Vladimir Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov's]] public response to Lowell's [[Osip Mandelstam|Mandelstam]] translations).&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Vladimir, &quot;On Adaptation&quot;. ''The New York Review of Books'', December 4, 1969 and ''Strong Opinions'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Lowell's ''Collected Poems'', the poet [[Michael Hofmann]] wrote that although he thought ''Life Studies'' was Lowell's best book, ''Imitations'' was Lowell's most &quot;pivotal book,&quot; arguing that the book &quot;marks the entry into his work of what one might term ‘international style’, something coolly open to not-quite-English.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, Michael. &quot;His Own Prophet.&quot; London Times Book Review. 11 Sept. 2003. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n17/michael-hofmann/his-own-prophet]&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Lowell explained that his idiosyncratic translations should be thought of as &quot;imitations&quot; rather than strict translations since he took many liberties with the originals, trying to &quot;do what [his] authors might have done if they were writing their poems now and in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Robert. Imitations. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

His next book ''For the Union Dead'' (1964) was widely praised, particularly for its title poem, which invoked Allen Tate's &quot;[[Ode to the Confederate Dead]].&quot; ''For the Union Dead'' was Lowell's first book since ''Life Studies'' to contain all original verse (since it did not include any translations), and in writing the poems in this volume, Lowell built upon the looser, more personal style of writing that he'd established in the final section of ''Life Studies''. However, none of the poems in ''For the Union Dead'' explicitly addressed the taboo subject of Lowell's mental illness (like some of the poems in ''Life Studies'' did) and were, therefore, not notably &quot;confessional&quot;. The subject matter in ''For the Union Dead'' was also much broader than it was in ''Life Studies''. For instance, Lowell wrote about a number of world historical figures in poems like &quot;Caligula,&quot; &quot;Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts,&quot; and &quot;Lady Raleigh's Lament.&quot;

In 1964, Lowell also tried his hand at playwrighting with three, one-act plays that were meant to be performed together as a trilogy, titled ''[[The Old Glory]]''. The first two parts, &quot;Endecott the Red Cross&quot; and &quot;My Kinsman, Major Molineux&quot; were stage adaptations of short stories by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and the third part, &quot;Benito Cereno,&quot; was a stage adaptation of a [[Benito Cereno|novella]] by [[Herman Melville]]. ''The Old Glory'' was produced off-Broadway in New York City in 1964 and won five [[Obie Awards]] in 1965 including an award for &quot;Best American Play.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.macmillan.com/theoldglory/RobertLowell Publisher's play synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/obies/index/1965/ Obie Awards for 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; The play was published in its first printing in 1965 (with a revised edition following in 1968).

In 1967, Lowell published his next book of poems, ''Near the Ocean''. With this volume, Lowell returned to writing more formal, metered verse. The second half of the book also shows Lowell returning once again to writing loose translations (including verse approximations of [[Dante]], [[Juvenal]], and [[Horace]]). The best known poem in this volume is &quot;Waking Early Sunday Morning,&quot; which was written in eight-line tetrameter stanzas (borrowed from [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem &quot;Upon Appleton House&quot;) and showed contemporary American politics overtly entering into Lowell's work.

orbiting forever lost
in our monotonous sublime.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source =From &quot;Waking Early Sunday Morning,&quot;&lt;br/&gt; ''Near the Ocean'' (1967)}}

During 1967 and 1968 he experimented with a verse journal, published as ''Notebook 1967-68'' (and later republished in a revised and expanded edition, titled ''Notebook''). Lowell referred to these fourteen-line poems as [[sonnets]] although they sometimes failed to incorporate regular meter and rhyme (both of which are defining features of the sonnet form); however, some of Lowell's sonnets (particularly the ones in ''Notebook 1967-1968'') were written in blank verse with a definitive pentameter and a small handful also included rhyme. Regarding the issue of meter in these poems, Lowell wrote &quot;My meter, fourteen line unrhymed blank verse sections, is fairly strict at first and elsewhere, but often corrupts in single lines to the freedom of prose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowell, Robert 1968&quot;&gt;Lowell, Robert. Notebook 1967-1968. Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux. New York: 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Notebook'' poems, Lowell included the poem &quot;In The Cage,&quot; a sonnet that he'd originally published in his first book, ''Lord Weary's Castle''. He also included revised, sonnet versions of the poems &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;Night-Sweat&quot; (originally published in ''For the Union Dead'') and of &quot;1958&quot; and &quot;To Theodore Roethke: 1908-1963&quot; (originally published in ''Near the Ocean''). In his &quot;Afterthought&quot; at the end of ''Notebook 1967-1968'', Lowell explained the premise and timeline of the book: &lt;blockquote&gt;This is not my diary, my confession, not a puritan's too literal pornographic honesty, glad to share private embarassment, and triumph. The time is a summer, an autumn, a winter, a spring, another summer; here the poem ends, except for turned-back bits of fall and winter 1968 ... My plot rolls with the seasons. The separate poems and sections are opportunist and inspired by impulse. Accident threw up subjects, and the plot swallowed them--famished for human chances. I lean heavily to the rational, but am devoted to surrealism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowell, Robert 1968&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In this same &quot;Afterthought&quot; section, Lowell acknowledges some of his source materials for the poems, writing, &quot;I have taken from many books, used the throwaway conversational inspirations of my friends, and much more that I idly spoke to myself.&quot; Some of the sources and authors he cites include [[Jesse Glenn Gray|Jesse Glenn Gray's]] ''The Warriors'', [[Simone Weil|Simone Weil's]] ''Half a Century Gone'', [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Aijaz Ahmad]], [[R.P. Blackmur]], [[Plutarch]], [[Stonewall Jackson]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowell, Robert 1968&quot;/&gt;

Steven Gould Axelrod wrote that, &quot;[Lowell's concept behind the sonnet form] was to achieve the balance of freedom and order, discontinuity and continuity, that he [had] observed in [[Wallace Stevens|[Wallace] Stevens's]] late long poems and in John Berryman's ''[[The Dream Songs|Dream Songs]],'' then nearing completion. He hoped that his form ... would enable him 'to describe the immediate instant,' an instant in which political and personal happenings interacted with a lifetime's accumulation of memories, dreams, and knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Steven Gould, Robert Lowell: Life and Art, Princeton University Press, 1978.
&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell liked the new form so much that he reworked and revised many of the poems from ''Notebook'' and used them as the foundation for his next three volumes of verse, all of which employed the same loose, fourteen-line sonnet form.

===1970s to the present===
The first book in Lowell's ''Notebook''-derived trilogy was ''History'' (1973) which primarily dealt with [[world history]] from antiquity up to the mid-20th century (although the book does not always follow a linear or logical path and contains many poems about Lowell's friends, peers, and family).  The second book, ''For Lizzie and Harriet'' (1973), describes the breakdown of his second marriage and contains poems that are supposed to be in the voices of his daughter, Harriet, and his second wife, Elizabeth. Finally, the last work in Lowell's sonnet sequence, ''The Dolphin'' (1973), which won the 1974 Pulitzer Prize, includes poems about his daughter, his ex-wife, and his new wife Caroline Blackwood whom he had affectionately nicknamed &quot;Dolphin.&quot; Notably, the book only contained new poems, making it the only book in Lowell's sonnet trilogy not to include revised and reordered poems from ''Notebook''.

A minor controversy erupted when Lowell admitted to having incorporated (and altered) private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick into poems for ''The Dolphin''. He was particularly criticized for this by his friends [[Adrienne Rich]]&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod. Stephen. &quot;Lowell's Comeback?&quot; ''The New England Quarterly''  Vol. 77, No. 2. June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and Elizabeth Bishop.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Vendler&quot;/&gt; Bishop made an eloquent and thoughtful argument to Lowell against publishing ''The Dolphin''. In a letter to Lowell regarding ''The Dolphin'', dated March 21, 1972, before he'd published the book, Bishop praises the writing, saying, &quot;Please believe that I think it is wonderful poetry.&quot; But then she states, &quot;I'm sure my point is only too plain ... Lizzie [Hardwick] is not dead, etc.--but there is a 'mixture of fact &amp; fiction' [in the book], and you have ''changed'' [Hardwick's] letters. That is 'infinite mischief,' I think ... One can use one's life as material--one does anyway--but these letters--aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission--IF you hadn't changed them ... etc. But ''art just isn't worth that much''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell''. Ed. Thomas Travisano and Saskia Hamilton. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adrienne Rich was not as diplomatic as Bishop. Instead of sending Lowell a private letter on the matter, she publically criticized Lowell and his books ''The Dolphin'' and ''To Lizzie and Harriet'' in a review that appeared in the ''American Poetry Review'' and that effectively ended the two poets' long-standing friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack, Kathleen. ''With Robert Lowell and His Circle''. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical response to Lowell's sonnets from the ''Notebook'' poems through to ''The Dolphin'' met with mixed responses upon publication, and critical consensus on the poems continues to be mixed. Lowell's contemporaries, like [[Derek Walcott]] and [[William Morris Meredith, Jr.|William Meredith]], praised the poems upon their publication. Meredith wrote about ''Notebook: 1967-68'', &quot;Complex and imperfect, like most of the accomplishments of serious men and women today, Robert Lowell's ''Notebook 1967-68'' is nevertheless a beautiful and major work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, William. &quot;Notebook 1967-68.&quot; The New York Times. 15 June 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; But a review of ''History'', ''For Lizzie and Harriet'', and ''The Dolphin'' by Calvin Bedient in ''The New York Times'' was mostly negative. Bedient wrote, &quot;Inchoate and desultory, the poems never accumulate and break in the great way, like a waterfall seen from the lip, more felt than seen. In truth, they are under no pressure to go anywhere, except to the 14th line. Prey to random associations, they are full of false starts, fractures, distractions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedient, Calvin. &quot;Visions and Revisions-Three New Volumes by America's First Poet.&quot; The New York Times. 29 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of Lowell's ''Collected Poems'' in 2003, a number of critics and poets have praised the sonnets, including Michael Hofmann, [[William Logan (poet)|William Logan]], and [[Richard Tillinghast]] (though Logan and Hofmann note that they both strongly preferred the original ''Notebook'' versions of the sonnets over the revised versions that Lowell published in ''History'' and ''To Lizzie and Harriet'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n17/michael-hofmann/his-own-prophet |title=Michael Hofmann reviews ‘Collected Poems’ by Robert Lowell, edited by Frank Bidart and David Gewanter · LRB 11 September 2003 |publisher=Lrb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-achievement-of-Robert-Lowell-1611 |title=The achievement of Robert Lowell by Richard Tillinghast |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the sonnet volumes have also received recent negative responses as well. In an otherwise glowing review of Lowell's ''Collected Poems'', [[A.O. Scott]] wrote, &quot;The three sonnet sequences Lowell published in 1973 ... occupy nearly 300 pages, and reading them, one damn sonnet after the other, induces more stupor than rapture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;AO Scott's Collected Poems review on Slate[http://www.slate.com/id/2084651/&quot;A Life's Study: Why Robert Lowell is America's most important career poet&quot;.] ''Slate magazine''. June 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; And in her review of the ''Collected Poems'', Marjorie Perloff called the sonnet poems &quot;trivial and catty,&quot;  considering them to be Lowell's least important volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Perloff's ''Collected Poems'' Review[http://marjorieperloff.com/reviews/lowell-return/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowell published his last volume of poetry, ''[[Day by Day (poetry)|Day by Day]]'', in 1977, the year of his death. In May 1977, Lowell won the $10,000 National Medal for Literature awarded by the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/lowell-obit.pdf Lowell's obit in NY Times 9/13/1977]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Day by Day'' was awarded that year's [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for poetry.   In a PBS documentary on Lowell, Anthony Hecht said that &quot;[''Day by Day'' was] a very touching, moving, gentle book, tinged with a sense of [Lowell's] own pain and the pain [he'd] given to others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Voices and Visions Video Series. Robert Lowell. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Lowell's only volume to contain nothing but free verse. In many of the poems, Lowell reflects on his life, his past relationships, and his own mortality. The best-known poem from this collection is the last one, titled &quot;Epilogue,&quot; in which Lowell reflects upon the &quot;confessional&quot; school of poetry with which his work was associated. In this poem he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;But sometimes everything I write&lt;br/&gt;
 with the threadbare art of my eye&lt;br/&gt;
 seems a snapshot,&lt;br/&gt;
 lurid, rapid, garish, grouped,&lt;br/&gt;
 heightened from life,&lt;br/&gt;
 yet paralyzed by fact.&lt;br/&gt;
 All's misalliance.&lt;br/&gt;
 Yet why not say what happened?&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, Robert. ''Collected Poems''. Edited by Frank Bidart and David Gewanter. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The book has received significant critical attention from the literary scholar and critic Helen Vendler who has written about the book in essays and in her book ''Last Looks, Last Books: Stevens, Plath, Lowell, Bishop, Merrill'' (2010). In her essay &quot;Robert Lowell's Last Days and Last Poems,&quot; she defends the book from attacks following its publication in reviews, like the one written by [[Donald Hall]] in which he called the book a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vendler, Helen 1979&quot;&gt;Vendler, Helen, &quot;Robert Lowell's Last Days and Last Poems.&quot; ''Robert Lowell: A Tribute''. Edited by Rolando Anzilotti. Pisa: Nistri-Lischi, 1979. 156-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Vendler wrote that some critics who came to this conclusion were disappointed because Lowell's last book was so much different than any of his previous volumes, abandoning ambitious metaphors and political engagement for more personal snapshots. She wrote, &quot;Now [Lowell] has ended [his career], in ''Day by Day'', as a writer of disarming openness, exposing shame and uncertainty, offering almost no purchase to interpretation, and in his journal-keeping, abandoning conventional structure, whether rhetorical or logical. The poems drift from one focus to another; they avoid the histrionic; they sigh more often than they expostulate. They acknowledge exhaustion; they expect death.&quot; She praises some of Lowell's descriptions, particularly his descriptions of [[impotence]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[old age]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vendler, Helen 1979&quot;/&gt;

Lowell's ''Collected Poems'', edited by Frank Bidart and David Gewanter, was published in 2003. The ''Collected Poems'' was a very comprehensive volume that included all of Lowell's major works with the exception of ''Notebook 1967-1968'' and ''Notebook''. However, many of the poems from these volumes were republished, in revised forms, in ''History'' and ''For Lizzie and Harriet''. On the heels of the publication of ''The Collected Poems'', ''The Letters of Robert Lowell'', edited by Saskia Hamilton, was published in 2005. Both Lowell's ''Collected Poems'' and his ''Letters'' received overwhelmingly positive critical responses from the mainstream press, and their publication has since led to a renewed interest in Lowell's writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/books/review/26KIRNL.html?_r=1&quot;The Passions of Robert Lowell&quot; June 26, 2005] ''New York Times''.

'''Leonardo Cimino''' (November 4, 1917&amp;nbsp;– March 3, 2012) was an American film, television  and stage actor who in 1937 appeared in the original stage production of [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''. Leonardo's most well known roles are in the 1983 science fiction miniseries, ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'' as Abraham Bernstein and the 1987 feature film ''[[The Monster Squad]]'' as the &quot;scary German guy.&quot;

==Life and career==
Born in Manhattan, Cimino was the son of Andrea and Leonilda Cimino. His father was a tailor. Cimino was initially interested in pursuing a career as a violinist, and studied the instrument at the [[Juilliard School]] when he was a teenager. While studying the violin he became interested in acting and dancing, and began studying those as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; In 1936, at the age of 18, he made his professional stage debut in a supporting role in the world premiere of [[Gladys Bronwyn Stern]]'s ''Middle Man'' in [[Suffern, New York]] which starred actor [[Ernest Truex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F1EFA345B1B7B93CAA91782D85F428385F9&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Leonardo+Cimino&amp;st=p|title=Middle Man Seen By Suffern Audience: Ernest Truex Is Star in New G.B. Stern Play as County Theatre's Season Closes|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 8, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until a decade later, however, that Cimino would become dedicated full-time to an acting career. During the late 1930s and early 1940s he studied acting, directing and modern dance at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Cimino joined the [[United States Army]] in 1942. He notably participated in the [[invasion of Normandy]], landing with the [[Mission Boston|second wave]] on June 6, 1944.

After returning to the United States in 1945 he continued to study the performing arts at the Neighborhood Playhouse; notably studying dance with [[Martha Graham]]. In 1946 he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadaway]] debut in a revival of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which starred and was directed by [[José Ferrer]]. It was the first of many projects that Cimino would collaborate with Ferrer on.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; He went on to appear in nearly 20 Broadway productions over the next four decades, including a 1962 adaptation of [[E. M. Forster]]’s ''[[Passage to India]]'' and a 1985 revival of ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''. In 1976 he was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his performance of the role of Jim in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''.

Cimino also appeared in numerous [[Off-Broadway]] productions during his career, notably winning an [[Obie Award]] in 1958 for his portrayal of Smerdyakov in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. He frequently appeared Off-Broadway in Shakespear plays at the [[Public Theater]], including Egeon in ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1975) alongside [[Ted Danson]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. He also appeared in productions in Regional theatres across the United States during his career. In 1970 he was awarded the [[Joseph Jefferson Award]] for Best Actor in a Principal Role for his performance in ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'' at the [[Goodman Theatre]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

Cimino made guest appearances on TV shows, some of those appearances range from ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'', ''[[The Equalizer]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.

Cimino died on March 3, 2012 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at his home in [[Woodstock, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/arts/leonardo-cimino-a-distinctive-actor-dies-at-94.html|title=Leonardo Cimino Dies at 94; Distinctive Actor|author=Daniel E.

'''Lanford Wilson''' (April 13, 1937{{spaced ndash}}March 24, 2011) was an American [[playwright]] who helped to advance the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theater movement, producing his earliest plays in New York at the [[Caffe Cino]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1&gt;Fox, Margalit. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/theater/lanford-wilson-pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-dies-at-73.html &quot;Lanford Wilson, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Playwright, Dies at 73&quot;,]  ''The New York Times'', March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1980 and was elected in 2001 to the [[Theater Hall of Fame]]. In 2004, Wilson was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and received the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] as a Master American Dramatist.  He was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]] and has won a [[Drama Desk Award]] and an [[Obie Award]].

Wilson was raised in Missouri by his mother, but in 1956 he moved to California, where he worked and attended college.  There, Wilson lived with his father, who did not accept Wilson's homosexuality, and so, in 1957, he moved to Chicago, where he worked as a graphic artist and studied playwriting.  In 1962, he moved to New York and began to write plays for [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatres.  His 1964 short play, ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'', was his first significant success and led to further works treating gay identity and other social and romantic issues throughout the 1960s.  In 1969, he was a co-founder of [[Circle Repertory Company]], for whom he wrote many plays in the 1970s.   His 1973 play, ''[[The Hot L Baltimore]]'', was the company's first major hit with both audiences and critics; its [[Off-Broadway]] run exceeded 1,000 performances.

Wilson's ''[[Fifth of July]]'' was first produced at Circle Rep in 1978; for its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opening in 1980, he received a Tony Award nomination.  A prequel, ''[[Talley's Folly]]'' (1979 at Circle Rep.), opened on Broadway before ''Fifth of July'' and won him the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and his first Tony nomination. ''[[Burn This]]'' (1987) was another Broadway success.  Wilson also wrote the [[libretto|libretti]] for several 20th-century operas.  In later years, he lived mostly in [[Sag Harbor]] on [[Long Island]] and continued to write plays into the 21st century.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wilson was born to Ralph Eugene and Violetta Tate Wilson in [[Lebanon, Missouri]]. After his parents' divorce, he moved with his mother to [[Springfield, Missouri]], where they lived until she remarried.  He had two half-brothers, John and Jim, and one stepsister, Judy.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;  When he was 11, they moved to [[Ozark, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Barnett2&gt;Barnett, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; There, he attended high school and developed a love for film and art.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} As a child, Wilson enjoyed writing short stories and going to see plays performed at Southwest Missouri State College (now [[Missouri State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in acting and played roles in his high school plays, including Tom in &quot;[[The Glass Menagerie]]&quot; by [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Ozark High School in 1955, Wilson began his collegiate studies at Southwest Missouri State College.&lt;ref name=BarnettChrono&gt;Barnett, ''Chronology''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he moved to [[San Diego, California]], where his father had relocated after his parents' divorce.&lt;ref name=Barnett2/&gt; He studied art and art history at San Diego State College (now [[San Diego State University]]) and also worked as a riveter in the Ryan Aircraft Plant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; His time with his father proved to be difficult, leaving Wilson feeling unwanted and unaccepted as a homosexual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He left school and moved to Chicago in 1957, where he worked as a graphic artist for an advertising firm.&lt;ref name=BarnettChrono/&gt; During this time, Wilson realized that the short stories he had always enjoyed writing would be more effective as plays, and so he took playwriting at the [[University of Chicago]] extension.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Chris. [http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2011/03/pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-lanford-wilson-dead-at-73.html &quot;Pulitzer Prize-winning Playwright Lanford Wilson Dead at 73&quot;], ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[Image:Wiki02CinoFront1965.jpg|thumb|left|The Caffe Cino, July 1965]]
In 1962, Wilson moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City.  He worked in odd jobs before finding a job in the subscriptions office of the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  Wilson began his professional career as a playwright writing [[one-act play]]s for [[Caffe Cino]], a coffeehouse and small theatre run by [[Joe Cino|Joseph Cino]], a pioneer of the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caffecino.wordpress.com/1939/01/01/lanford-wilson/ Caffe Cino Pictures: Lanford Wilson: The Mozart from Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His works for Caffe Cino include ''Ludlow Fair'', ''[[Home Free!]]'' and ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]''. He worked odd jobs to support himself during this Off-Off-Broadway apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Madness of Lady Bright'' premiered at Caffe Cino in May 1964 and was the venue's first significant success. The play concerns Leslie Bright, a neurotic aging [[drag queen]].  It is an important early stage representation of [[homosexuality]], but Wilson stated, &quot;If it's taken as the first homosexual play, I have a feeling that I'm not very fond of it. ...  That will pass, I think, and it'll be just the story of a lonely person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for over 200 performances,&lt;ref name=Barnett5&gt;Barnett, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; setting a record as the longest-running play at Caffe Cino.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busby, p&quot;&gt;Busby, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1965, Wilson also began writing plays for Ellen Stewart's [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]].&lt;ref name=Barnett5/&gt;  His first full-length plays premiered there, including ''[[Balm in Gilead]]'', which depicted a doomed romance in an urban greasy spoon diner inhabited by junkies, prostitutes and thieves.&lt;ref name=Barnett5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at La MaMa in 1965, directed by [[Marshall W. Mason]], and was revived in 1984 in a collaboration between [[Circle Repertory Company]] and the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]]. The revival was directed by [[John Malkovich]].&lt;ref&gt;Schvey, Henry I. &quot;Heathcliff in Manhattan: Fire and Ice in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This''&quot; in Bryer, pp. 151–60&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rimers of Eldritch]]'' (1967), which dwelt on  hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness in a small town in the rural Midwest, won the 1966–1967 [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award]] for contribution to Off-Broadway theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, pp. 9 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''The Gingham Dog'' (1968) about the breakup of an interracial couple.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson described ''[[Lemon Sky]]'' (1970) as &quot;directly autobiographical&quot;; the narrator, Alan, Wilson's representation of himself, describes an attempt to reconcile with his long-absent father.  Son and father fail to meet each other's expectations, and Alan leaves, disillusioned by his father's authoritarianism and narrow-mindedness.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circle Rep. and later years===
[[File:Lee Taylor-Allen &amp; Kenneth Boys.jpg|thumb|A scene from the 1986 New York revival of ''[[Home Free!]]'']]
Wilson was a co-founder, in 1969, with his collaborator Mason and others, of [[Circle Repertory Company]].  Many of his plays were first presented there, directed by Mason.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lunden, Jeff. [http://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134855822/for-lanford-wilson-the-plays-were-always-personal &quot;For Lanford Wilson, the Plays Were Always Personal&quot;], www.npr.org, March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  His first plays at Circle Rep., ''The Great Nebula in Orion'', ''Ikke, Ikke, Nye, Nye, Nye'', and ''The Family Continues'', premiered in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's ''[[The Hot l Baltimore]]'', about lowlifes who face eviction when the decaying hotel in which they live is to be demolished, opened in 1973 and was Circle Rep.'s first commercial success; it also won the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award and the [[Obie Award]].&lt;ref name=Williams3134&gt;Williams, pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt; It transferred to the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]], then [[Off-Broadway]], and ran for 1,166 performances.&lt;ref name=Barnett8586&gt;Barnett, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a short-lived television series by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1975, which Wilson pronounced &quot;a disaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=Williams3134/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barnett8586/&gt; In 1975, Wilson's ''The Mound Builders'', which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as Wilson's &quot;most ambitious work&quot;, premiered at Circle Rep.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Its story concerned an ill-fated archeological dig in the Midwest, and, thematically, it contemplated the futility of man's achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, pp. 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;  Circle Repertory Company produced Wilson's ''[[Serenading Louie]]'' in 1976.  The play had been unsuccessfully performed in 1970 by the Washington Theater Club, and Wilson revised it for Circle Rep.'s 1976 production, which is generally regarded as its official premiere.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also a founding member of the [[New York State Summer School of the Arts]], of which Circle Rep. was the theatre contingent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busby, p&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}

Gay [[sexual identity|identity]] is a major theme in Wilson's work.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034376?categoryid=4076&amp;cs=1&amp;cmpid=RSS%7CNews%7CLatestNews Lanford Wilson, ''Burn This'' playwright, dies at 73&quot;], ''Variety'', March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Madness of Lady Bright'', ''Lemon Sky'', ''[[Fifth of July]]'' (1978) and ''[[Burn This]]'' (1986) all deal with sexual identity.  In ''[[Fifth of July]]'', a hit on Broadway in 1980–82, members of the Talley family decide whether to sell the family farmhouse in Missouri; the story centers on Ken Tally, a disabled [[Vietnam War]] veteran, and his lover Jed, who are currently living in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] for ''Fifth of July''.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Mark|title=Tony Award-Winning Playwright Lanford Wilson Dies| url= http://www.backstage.com/bso/content_display/news-and-features/e3i9343b011681a9d0d67eead562686e1c6 |work=Backstage |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Fifth of July'', Wilson wrote ''[[Talley's Folly]]'' (1979), a two-person play depicting how midwestern Sally Talley and Jewish Matt Friedman fall in love and become engaged, despite the objections of Sally's narrow-minded family.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martine, James J. &quot;Charlotte's Daughters: Changing Gender Roles and Family Structures in Lanford Wilson&quot; in Bryer, pp. 37–63&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talley &amp; Son]]'' premiered as ''A Tale Told'' in 1981 but was substantially rewritten and renamed, opening in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Both are prequels, set 30 years prior to ''Fifth of July''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talley's Folly]]'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1980 and received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Angels Fall]]'' was not a success on Broadway in 1983, but earned Wilson his third nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  In ''[[Burn This]]'', a young gay dancer named Robbie and his lover Dom have died in a boating accident before the play begins. Robbie's roommates, his sensitive dance partner Anna and gay, confident Larry, must come to terms with Robbie's death. Anna learns to be independent and self-confident; she pursues her interest in choreography and begins a relationship with Robbie's grieving brother Pale, breaking off her dispassionate relationship with her longtime boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, Martin J. &quot;'The Monster Within' in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This''&quot; in Bryer, pp. 131–49&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' theatre critic [[Ben Brantley]] said that Wilson's plays reflect &quot;disenchantment with the state of the nation. ...  A couple plays, at least, featured embittered [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] veterans. At the same time, he harked back to the era of more sentimental plays – of portraits of losers on the margins of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lunden&gt;Lunden, Jeff. [http://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134855822/for-lanford-wilson-the-plays-were-always-personal &quot;For Lanford Wilson, The Plays Were Always Personal&quot;], NPR, March 25, 2011, accessed March 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson and Mason encouraged so-called [[method acting|&quot;method&quot; acting]] and often used the classic techniques of [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryer, Jackson R. &quot;'Hell Is Watching Your Script Done Badly': An Interview with Lanford Wilson&quot;. ''Lanford Wilson: A Casebook'', New York: Garland Pub., 1994, pp. 183–203&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Malkovich, [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]], [[William Hurt]], [[Jeff Daniels]], and [[Christopher Reeve]] were among the actors who starred in Wilson and Mason's productions.&lt;ref name=Lunden/&gt;  In 2004, Wilson received the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] for a Master American Dramatist.

In addition to writing plays, Wilson wrote the texts for several 20th-century [[opera]]s, collaborating with composer [[Lee Hoiby]] for ''Summer and Smoke'' (1971), and adapting his own play, ''This is the Rill Speaking'' (1992).&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name=ON&gt;[http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=19386 &quot;Lee Hoiby, 85, American Opera Composer, Has Died&quot;,] ''Opera News'', March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Summer and Smoke'' is an adaptation of the [[Tennessee Williams]] [[Summer and Smoke|play of the same name]].  Williams gave composer Hoiby permission to compose an opera based on the play, and Hoiby asked Wilson to adapt the play into libretto form.&lt;ref name=Barnett106&gt;Barnett, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; ''This is the Rill Speaking'' is a one-act [[chamber opera]] that Wilson adapted from his own play of the same name.&lt;ref name=ON/&gt;  In 1984, Wilson wrote a new translation of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' for the Hartford Stage Company.&lt;ref name=Londre&gt;Hardison Londré, Felicia. &quot;From Provincial Yearnings to Urban Danger: Lanford Wilson's ''Three Sisters'' and ''Burn This''&quot; in Bryer, pp. 119–30&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson strove to make his translation sound like everyday speech; he thought that existing translations were linguistically accurate but were not inherently theatrical.&lt;ref name=Londre/&gt; Reviews of the Hartford production and a subsequent production by the Steppenwolf Theater Ensemble of Chicago praised Wilson's idiomatic dialogue.&lt;ref name=Londre/&gt;

In 2010, [[Debra Monk]] presented Wilson with the Artistic Achievement Award from the [[New York Innovative Theatre Awards]].  This honor was awarded by the Off-Off-Broadway community &quot;in recognition of his brave and unique works that helped establish the Off-Off-Broadway community and propel the independent theatre voice as an important contributor to the American stage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andronico, Michael.

===Personal life and death===
After Wilson moved to New York City in 1962, he settled in an apartment in West Greenwich Village on Sheridan Square, where he lived for many years.  In the 1970s, he bought a house in [[Sag Harbor]], [[Long Island]], New York.&lt;ref name=BarnettChrono/&gt; He lived in both places, using his Manhattan apartment mainly when he had a play in production there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

When living in Manhattan, he worked with Playwrights Laboratory at the Circle Repertory Company, often attending readings, rehearsals, and productions. Around 1998, he finally gave up his apartment in New York and lived full-time in Sag Harbor. Wilson was openly homosexual and never had children. In 2004, he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He also became active with the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, where some of his new short plays were produced, along with his 1996 world premiere comedy 'Virgil Is Still The Frogboy' which was commissioned by Bay Street Theatre (underwritten by VANITY FAIR); the title of the play having to do with a famous bit of graffiti spray-painted on a railroad bridge that had puzzled local citizens of the Hamptons for years.  Directed by Marshall W. Mason, it starred Arija Bareiikis, Bobby Cannavale, Jennifer Dundas, Thomas McCarthy and Josh Pais, and ran from August 14 to September 9.    {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

On March 24, 2011, Wilson died, aged 73, from complications of pneumonia.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;

==Early life and family==
Close was born in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Connecticut]], the daughter of Bettine (''[[married and maiden names|née]]'' Moore) and [[William Close|William Taliaferro Close]],&lt;ref name=5dylcdw&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Notable Kin - Additional Noted American Cousin: A Five-Year Update, Numbers 326-350|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society - Founded 1845|year=2010|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/notable-kin-additional-cousins-of-the-princess-of-wales/|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a doctor who operated a clinic in the [[Belgian Congo]] and served as a personal physician to Congo/Zaire President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Conscience and the Congo&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06333/741921-374.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Conscience and the Congo | date=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a descendant of the [[Taliaferro]]s of [[Virginia]]; her paternal grandfather, Edward Bennett Close, a stockbroker and director of the [[American Hospital Association]],&lt;ref name=&quot;movies.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019740/bio |title=Glenn Close Biography&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

During her childhood, Close lived with her parents in a stone cottage in Greenwich.&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Close has credited her early years for her acting abilities: &quot;I have no doubt that the days I spent running free in the evocative Connecticut countryside with an unfettered imagination, playing whatever character our games demanded, is one of the reasons that acting has always seemed so natural to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a speech at [[Princeton University]] on February 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When she was seven years old, her parents joined a &quot;cult group&quot;, the [[Moral Re-Armament]] (MRA), in which her family remained involved for fifteen years, living in communal centers. Close has stated that the family &quot;struggled to survive the pressures of a culture that dictated everything about how we lived our lives.&quot; Close traveled for several years in the mid-to-late 1960s with an MRA singing group called [[Up With People]], and attended [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Rosemary Hall]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall), graduating in 1965.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CHOATE&quot;&gt;[http://www.choate.edu/alumni/prizewinners.asp Rosemary Hall Alumnae Award] from the [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] website&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 22, Close broke away from MRA, attending the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], and majoring in theatre. It was in the College's theatre department that she began to train as a serious actor, under Howard Scammon.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/20090219_publect_close.shtml |title=Glenn Close: &quot;Are You Who We Think You Are?&quot; |publisher=Princeton.edu |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected to membership in the honor society of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;

In 2010, Fallout New Vegas included Alice, which was still designed to look like Close, but Marianne Muellerleile voiced Alice.

'''Joseph Chaikin''' (September 16, 1935 – June 22, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[theatre]] [[Theatre director|director]], [[playwright]], and [[pedagogue]].

==Early years==
The youngest of five children, Chaikin was born to a poor Jewish family living in the Borough Park residential area of Brooklyn.  At the age of six, he was struck with rheumatic fever, and he continued to suffer from resulting heart complications throughout his life. At the age of ten, he was sent to the National Children's Cardiac Hospital in Florida. It was during this period of isolation he began to organize theater games with other children. After two years in Florida, his health improved, and he was returned to his family, who had moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where his father had taken a job teaching.

Chaikin briefly attended [[Drake University]] in [[Iowa]], and then returned to New York to begin a career in theater, studying with various acting coaches, while struggling to survive working a variety of jobs. He appeared as a figurant at the Metropolitan Opera, and gradually began to be cast in legitimate stage roles, going on to work with [[The Living Theatre]] before founding in 1963 [[The Open Theater]] a theater co-operative that progressed from a closed experimental laboratory to a performance ensemble.

==Career==

Open Theater allowed Chaikin and his colleagues the space experiment with unconventional and organic drama techniques. They embraced dance and musical performance practices and encouraged actors to be more expressive in the body. When asked in a 1999 interview why he was compelled to start Open Theater, Chaikin responded, &quot;I’m not crazy about naturalism on stage. An actor is an interpretive artist. They can take their talent further. I wanted them to stretch, be creative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Liz. [http://bombsite.com/issues/68/articles/2252 &quot;Joseph Chaikin&quot;], [[Bomb Magazine]], Summer, 1998. Retrieved on June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Theatre's most famous and critically acclaimed production, ''[[The Serpent (play)|The Serpent]]'', was a unique creation developed largely from the actors' own experiences, using the Bible as text, but incorporating current events, such as the violence that plagued the 1960s. An Open Theatre exercise by [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]], &quot;Interview,&quot; became part of the play ''[[America Hurrah]]'', and Chaikin directed the &quot;Interview&quot; section when the play opened at the Pocket Theatre in 1966. In 1969 Open Theatre performed ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' by Samuel Beckett, with Chaikin playing the role of Hamm and Peter Maloney as Clov, at the Cite Universitaire, Paris, and in 1970 at the Grasslands Penitentiary, a fulfillment of Chaikin's desire to experiment with audiences who would be fundamentally and culturally different from cosmopolitan audiences. 

In 1970-71 Open Theatre performed Terminal by  [[Susan Yankowitz]], touring the production internationally as well as to many maximum and minimum security prisons in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The Open Theater operated for about ten years. Chaikin closed the Open Theatre in 1973 because he said it was in danger of becoming an institution. Although it achieved much critical success, Chaikin said: &quot;I have rarely known a case where a critic's response to actors, directors or writers has expanded or encouraged their talent- I ''have'' known cases where by panning or praising, the critic has crushed or discouraged creative inspiration&quot;. 

His first work after closing the Open Theatre was in collaboration with the playwright Robert Montgomery: ELECTRA, a three-character version of the Electra myth with Michele Collison (from Peter Brooks' company) in the title role, Paul Zimet as Orestes, and Shami Chaikin, Joe's sister, as Clytemnestra.  The work was a critical success in New York City, and later toured colleges in the United States with Tina Shepard in the title role.

In 1977, Chaikin formed an experimental workshop company called The Winter Project, whose members included [[Ronnie Gilbert]], [[Corey Fischer]], [[Robbie McCauley]], Mark Samuels, Robert Montgomery, [[Christopher McCann]] and [[Will Patton]], as well as core members of the previous Open Theatre, among others. In the Winter Project, Chaikin proposed and participated in explorations of the boundary between life and death, the actor as storyteller, listening, found dialogue and more. His production of [[The Dybbuk]] at the Public Theater in 1977-78 was, to some extent, influenced by some of these researches. Chaikin had a close working relationship with [[Sam Shepard]] and together they wrote the plays ''[[Tongues (play)|Tongues]]'' and ''[[Savage/Love]]'', both of which premiered at San Francisco's [[Magic Theatre]]. They were commissioned to write ''When The World Was Green'' for the [[1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], later collaborating to write ''[[War in Heaven]]''. Chaikin was an expert on [[Samuel Beckett]].  He adapted ''[[Stories and Texts for Nothing|Texts for Nothing]]'' with Steven Kent who directed him in a solo show based on the material which performed at the [[Public Theater]] in New York, at the Roundhouse Theatre in London, the American Center in Paris, and in Toronto. Chaikin  directed a number of Beckett's plays, including ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] and ''[[Happy Days]]'' at [[Cherry Lane Theater]]. 

Chaikin received six [[Obie Award]]s, including one for Lifetime Achievement, and two [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s.

His book, &quot;The Presence of The Actor&quot; was first published in 1972 by Theatre Communications Group, and a second edition followed in 1991. Based on his experiments with actors, the book includes exemplar notes, photographs, and exercises from Open Theatre productions, and records Chaikin's ideas about theater as a tool for social transformation.

In 2010, he was inducted, posthumously, into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/146911-Theater-Hall-of-Fame-Ceremony-Honoring-Linda-Lavin-Brian-Dennehy-Michael-Blakemore-Presented-Jan-24 Playbill.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1984, a [[stroke]] suffered during his third [[open-heart surgery]] left Chaikin with partial [[aphasia]]. Despite this barrier to communication, Chaikin continued to act, direct and to create plays in collaboration with other actors, writers, and groups including [[Mira Rafalowicz]], [[Traveling Jewish Theatre]], Michael Posnick and [[John Belluso]], whose disability-themed plays were produced at the [[Mark Taper Forum]], [[Trinity Rep]], [[Pacific Repertory Theatre]], [[Keen Company]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].  

Following Chaikin's stroke, several writers, including Jean-Claude van Itallie, Susan Yankowitz, and Sam Shepard, wrote plays specifically for Chaikin to perform and direct, most notably The War in Heaven which was directed by Steven Kent. Chaikin performed the piece in San Diego, Atlanta, and Parma, Italy,   Samuel Beckett's last poem, ''What Is the Word?'', was written for and dedicated to Chaikin.  Overpowering his aphasia once again, Chaikin publicly performed the poem. 

Chaikin was a lifelong teacher of acting and directing, and lived most of his adult life in New York's West Village, at [[Westbeth Artists Community]].

'''Terrence McNally''' (born November 3, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] who has received four [[Tony Award]]s, an [[Emmy Award]], two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller Grant]], the [[Lucille Lortel Award]], the [[Hull-Warriner Award]], and a citation from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/kqed/onenight/creativeprocess/players/mcnallybio.html|title=And Then One Night, The Making of Dead Man Walking: Creative Process: The Players: Terrence McNally: Biography|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has been a member of the Council of the [[Dramatists Guild]] since 1970 and has served as vice-president since 1981. McNally was partnered to Thomas Kirdahy following a civil union ceremony in Vermont in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED7143FF932A15751C1A9659C8B63|title=WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; Terrence McNally, Thomas Kirdahy|date=2003-12-21|accessdate=2007-04-19|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they subsequently married in Washington, D.C. on April 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2010/04/love_etc_playwright_terrence_m.html|title=Reliable Source - Love, etc.: Playwright Terrence McNally weds partner in D.C.|date=2010-04-06|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and raised in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], McNally moved to [[New York City]] in 1956 to attend [[Columbia University]], where he majored in [[English studies|English]] and wrote Columbia's annual [[Varsity Show]], graduating in 1960, the same year in which he gained membership into the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. He worked briefly for the alumni magazine ''Columbia College Today''.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduation, McNally moved to [[Mexico]] to focus on his writing, completing a one-act play which he submitted to the [[Actors Studio]] in [[New York]] for production. While the play was turned down by the acting school, the Studio was impressed with the script, and McNally was invited to serve as the Studio's [[Stage management|stage manager]] so that he could gain practical knowledge of theater. In his early years in New York, he was a protégé and lover of the noted playwright [[Edward Albee]]. Mr. McNally was also a longtime companion to noted actor Robert Drivas.

In 1968, McNally asked that his name be removed from the credits for what would have been his first major project, the musical ''[[Here's Where I Belong]]''. His decision proved to be a wise one, as the show closed after one performance. Although several early comedies such as ''[[Next (play)|Next]]'' in 1969 and ''[[The Ritz (play)|The Ritz]]'' in 1975 won McNally critical praise, it was not until later in his career that he would become truly successful with works such as his [[Off-Broadway]] play ''[[Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune]]'' and its screen adaptation with stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].

===Later career===
His first credited [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical was ''[[The Rink (musical)|The Rink]]'' in 1984, a project he entered after the score by composer [[John Kander]] and lyricist [[Fred Ebb]] had been written. In 1990, McNally won an [[Emmy Award]] for Best Writing in a Miniseries or Special for ''[[Andre's Mother]]'', a drama about a woman trying to cope with her son's death from [[AIDS]]. A year later, he returned to the stage with another AIDS-related play, ''[[Lips Together, Teeth Apart]]''. In the play, two married couples spend the Fourth of July weekend at a summer house on [[Fire Island]]. The house has been willed to Sally Truman by her brother who has just died of AIDS, and it soon becomes evident that both couples are afraid to get in the swimming pool once used by Sally's brother. It was written specifically for [[Christine Baranski]], [[Anthony Heald]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]], and oft-collaborator, [[Nathan Lane]], who had also starred in &quot;[[The Lisbon Traviata]]&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

With ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'' (based on the novel by [[Manuel Puig]]) in 1992, McNally returned to the musical stage, collaborating with Kander and Ebb on a script which explores the complex relationship between two men caged together in a Latin American prison. ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' won the 1993 [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical]]. He collaborated with [[Stephen Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens]] on ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' in 1997, a musical adaptation of the [[E.L. Doctorow]] novel, which tells the story of Coalhouse Walker Jr., a fiery black piano man who demands retribution when his [[Model T]] is destroyed by a mob of white troublemakers. The play also features such historical figures as [[Harry Houdini]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and [[Henry Ford]]. ''Ragtime'' finished its Broadway run on January 16, 2000.  A revival production in 2009 was short-lived, closing after only 2 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readperiodicals.com/201104/2236775641.html#b The Sondheim Review: Mutual admiration, Sondheim and playwright Terrence McNally began a collaboration in 1991, by Raymond-Jean Frontain, April 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

McNally's other plays include 1994's ''[[Love! Valour! Compassion!]]'', with Lane and [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], which examines the relationships of eight gay men; ''[[Master Class]]'' (1995); a character study of legendary opera soprano [[Maria Callas]], which starred [[Zoe Caldwell]] and won the Tony for Best Play; and the least-known of the group, ''Dedication, or The Stuff of Dreams'', with Lane and [[Marian Seldes]].

In 1997, McNally stirred up a storm of controversy with ''[[Corpus Christi (play)|Corpus Christi]]'', a modern day retelling of the story of Jesus' birth, ministry, and death in which both he and his disciples are portrayed as homosexual. In fact, the play was initially canceled because of death threats against the board members of the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] which was to produce the play. However, several other playwrights such as [[Tony Kushner]] threatened to withdraw their plays if ''Corpus Christi'' was not produced, and the board finally relented. When the play opened, the theatre was besieged by almost 2,000 protesters, furious at what they considered blasphemy. When ''Corpus Christi'' opened in London, a group called the ''Defenders of the Messenger Jesus''  issued a [[fatwa]] sentencing McNally to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/493436.stm|title=Fatwa for 'gay Jesus' writer|date=1999-10-29|accessdate=2007-04-19|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 19, 2008, [[Robert Forsyth]], [[Anglican]] bishop of South [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], condemned ''[[Corpus Christi (play)|Corpus Christi]]'' (which opened for February's Gay and Lesbian [[Mardi Gras]], a play depicting [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] seducing Jesus): ''&quot;It is deliberately, not innocently, offensive and they're obviously having a laugh about it.&quot;'' The play showed Jesus administrating a [[marriage]] between two male [[apostles]]. Director Leigh Rowney accepted that it would offend some [[Christians]] and said: &quot;I wanted this play in the hands of a Christian person like myself to give it dignity but still open it up to answering questions about Christianity as a faith system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iV-Zj0amGhXt70sCw8uQ3JmjrwIg  Afp.google.com, Row erupts in Australia over 'gay' Jesus play: report]&lt;/ref&gt;

McNally's drama ''Deuce'' ran on Broadway in a limited engagement in 2007 for 121 performances. Directed by [[Michael Blakemore]], the show starred [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Marian Seldes]].

The [[Kennedy Center]] presented three of McNally's plays that focus on his works involving opera, titled ''Nights at the Opera'' in March 2010. The pieces included a new play, ''Golden Age''; ''Master Class'', starring [[Tyne Daly]]; and ''The Lisbon Traviata'', starring [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] and [[Malcolm Gets]].&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136517-Casting-Complete-for-Master-Class-with-Daly-at-the-Kennedy-Center Casting Complete for Master Class, with Daly, at the Kennedy Center&quot;] playbill.com, February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138149-Glover-and-Gets-Open-McNallys-Lisbon-Traviata-in-Washington-DC-March-25 &quot;Glover and Gets Open McNally's Lisbon Traviata in Washington, D.C.

McNally has collaborated on several operas, including composer [[Jake Heggie]]'s adaptation of Sister [[Helen Prejean]]'s book, ''Dead Man Walking'', for which McNally wrote the libretto. In 2007, Heggie composed a chamber opera, ''Three Decembers'', based on original text by McNally titled ''Some Christmas Letters (and a Couple of Phone Calls, Too)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/49285-Terrence-McNally-Pens-NYC-Holiday-Letters-for-Dec-13-14-Benefit-Concert Terrence McNally Pens NYC Holiday 'Letters' for Dec. 13-14 Benefit Concert]&lt;/ref&gt; with libretto by [[Gene Scheer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-12-07/entertainment/17134053_1_composer-jake-heggie-lotfi-mansouri-dead-man-walking|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Carolyne|last=Zinko|title=S.F.

==Early life==
Bacon, one of six children, was born and raised in a close-knit family in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Bacon|url=http://www.biography.com/people/kevin-bacon-9542173|work=Biography.com|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Ruth Hilda (née Holmes; 1916–1991), taught at an elementary school and was a liberal activist, while his father, [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Norwood Bacon]] (May 2, 1910 – October 14, 2005), was a well-respected architect and a prominent Philadelphian who had been Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission for many years.  At 16, in 1975, Bacon won a full scholarship to and attended the [[Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts]] at Bucknell University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT KEVIN BACON|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/person/kevin-bacon/biography.html|work=yahoo movies|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state-funded five-week arts program at which he studied theatre under Dr. Glory Van Scott.  The experience solidified Bacon's passion for the arts.

==Acting career==
Bacon left home at age 17 to pursue a theater career in New York, where he appeared in a production at the [[Circle in the Square|Circle in the Square Theater School]]. &quot;I wanted life, man, the real thing&quot;, he later recalled to [[Nancy Mills]] of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. &quot;The message I got was 'The arts are it. Business is the devil's work. Art and creative expression are next to godliness.' Combine that with an immense ego and you wind up with an actor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmo91&quot;&gt;''Cosmopolitan''. March 1991, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bacon's debut in the [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] comedy ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' in 1978 did not lead to the fame for which he had hoped,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and Bacon returned to waiting tables and auditioning for small roles in theater. He briefly worked on the television soap operas ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' (1979) and ''[[Guiding Light]]'' (1980–81) in New York. In 1980, he had a prominent role in the now iconic slasher film [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|''Friday the 13th'']]. He refused an offer of a television series based on ''Animal House'' to be filmed in California in order to remain close to the New York stage{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . Some of his early stage work included ''Getting Out'' performed at New York's [[Phoenix Theater]], and ''[[Flux]]'' which he did at [[Second Stage Theatre]] during their 1981–1982 season.

In 1982, he won an [[Obie Award]] for his role in ''[[Forty Deuce]]'', and soon after made his Broadway debut in ''[[Slab Boys]]'', with then-unknowns [[Sean Penn]] and [[Val Kilmer]]. However, it was not until he portrayed Timothy Fenwick that same year in [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]''{{spaced ndash}}costarring [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Tim Daly]] and [[Ellen Barkin]]{{spaced ndash}}that he made an indelible impression on film critics and moviegoers alike.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
[[File:Kevin Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]
Bolstered by the attention garnered by his performance in ''Diner'', Bacon starred in the 1984 box-office smash ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''. Richard Corliss of ''TIME'' likened ''Footloose'' to the [[James Dean]] classic ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and the old [[Mickey Rooney]]/[[Judy Garland]] musicals, commenting that the film includes &quot;motifs on book burning, mid-life crisis, AWOL parents, fatal car crashes, drug enforcement, and Bible Belt vigilantism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time84&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950019,00.html|title=Revel Without a Cause|author=Richard Corliss|work=TIME|date=February 20, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for the role, Bacon enrolled at a high school as a transfer student named &quot;Ren McCormick&quot; and studied teenagers before leaving in the middle of the day.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Bacon did earn strong reviews for ''Footloose'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/522:492/1/Kevin_Bacon.htm|title=Kevin Bacon|publisher=Biography Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he appeared on the cover of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine soon after its release.
Bacon's critical and box-office success lead to a period of [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] in roles similar to the two he portrayed in ''Diner'' and ''Footloose''. Bacon would have difficulty shaking this on-screen image. For the next several years he chose films that cast him against either type and experienced, by his own estimation, a career slump. In 1988, he starred in [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' comedy ''[[She's Having a Baby]]'' and the following year he was in another comedy called ''[[The Big Picture (1989 film)|The Big Picture]]''.
In 1990, Bacon had two successful roles. He played a character who saved his town from under-the-earth &quot;graboid&quot; monsters in the comedy/horror film ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]''{{spaced ndash}}a role that ''People'' found him &quot;far too accomplished&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} to play{{spaced ndash}}and portrayed an earnest medical student experimenting with death in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Flatliners]]''.
Bacon's next project was to star opposite [[Elizabeth Perkins]] in ''[[He Said, She Said]]''. Despite lukewarm reviews and low audience turnout, ''He Said, She Said'' was illuminating for Bacon. Required to play a character with sexist attitudes, he admitted that the role was not that large a stretch for him.
By 1991, Bacon began to give up the idea of playing leading men in big-budget films and to remake himself as a character actor. &quot;The only way I was going to be able to work on 'A' projects with really 'A' directors was if I wasn't the guy who was starring&quot;, he confided to ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Trip Gabriel. &quot;You can't afford to set up a $40&amp;nbsp;million movie if you don't have your star.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt94&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A Second Wind Is Blowing For Kevin Bacon|author=Trip Gabriel|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6D91F3BF936A1575AC0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |date=September 25, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed that year as gay prostitute Willie O'Keefe in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. He went on to play a prosecuting attorney in the military courtroom drama ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]''. Later that year he returned to the theater to play in ''Spike Heels'', directed by [[Michael Greif]].
[[File:KevinBaconApr10.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bacon receiving a Merit Award in April 2010]]
In 1994, Bacon earned a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for his role in ''[[The River Wild]]'' opposite [[Meryl Streep]]. He described the film to Chase in ''Cosmopolitan'' as a &quot;grueling shoot,&quot; in which &quot;every one of us fell out of the boat at one point or another and had to be saved.&quot;
His next film, ''[[Murder in the First]]'', earned him the Broadcast Film Critic's Association Award in 1995, the same year that he starred in the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] hit ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.
Bacon reverted to his trademark dark role once again in ''[[Sleepers (film)|Sleepers]]'' in 1996. This role was in stark contrast to his appearance in the lighthearted romantic comedy, ''[[Picture Perfect (1997 film)|Picture Perfect]]'' the following year. Bacon also made his debut as a director in 1996 with the television film ''[[Losing Chase]]'', which was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, winning one.&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1997-02-07/283342/ |title=Losing Chase |last1=Macor |first1=Alison |date=February 7, 1997 |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |publisher= |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon again resurrected his oddball mystique that year as a mentally-challenged houseguest in ''[[Digging to China]]'', and as a disc jockey corrupted by [[payola]] in ''[[Telling Lies in America (film)|Telling Lies in America]]''. As the executive producer of 1998's ''[[Wild Things]]'', Bacon reserved a supporting role for himself, and went on to star in ''[[Stir of Echoes]]'' (directed by [[David Koepp]]) in 1999, and in [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s ''[[Hollow Man]]'' in 2000.

Bacon, [[Colin Firth]] and [[Rachel Blanchard]] depict a [[ménage à trois]] in their film, ''[[Where the Truth Lies]]''. Bacon and director [[Atom Egoyan]] have condemned the [[MPAA]] ratings board decision to give the film their &quot;[[MPAA film rating system|NC-17]]&quot; rating over the preferable &quot;R&quot;. Bacon decried the decision, commenting: &quot;I don't get it, when I see films (that) are extremely violent, extremely objectionable sometimes in terms of the roles that women play, slide by with an R, no problem, because the people happen to have more of their clothes on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Bacon irked over movie rating|author=Bruce Kirkland|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/2005/09/14/1216527.html|date=September 14, 2005|work=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon was again acclaimed for a dark starring role playing an offending [[pedophile]] on parole in the [[2004 in film|2004 film]] ''[[The Woodsman]]''; he was nominated best actor receiving the Independent Spirit Award.
He appeared in the [[HBO Films]] production of ''[[Taking Chance]]'', a film based on a story of the same name written by Lieutenant Colonel [[Michael Strobl]], an American '[[Desert Storm]]' war veteran. The film premiered on HBO on February 21, 2009. Bacon won a Golden Globe Award and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] for his role.
On July 15, 2010, it was confirmed that Bacon would appear in [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kit | first = Borys | url = http://heatvision.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/07/winters-bone-star-cast-as-mystique-in-xmen-first-class.html | title = 'Winter's Bone' star cast in 'X-Men: First Class' (exclusive) | work=Heat Vision | date = July 15, 2010 | accessdate =July 16, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His character was mutant villain [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.forcesofgeek.com/2010/07/kevin-bacon-playing-sebastian-shaw-in-x.html | title = KEVIN BACON Playing SEBASTIAN SHAW in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS | publisher=forcesofgeek.com | date = July 16, 2010 | accessdate =July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Bacon was featured in a performance of [[Dustin Lance Black]]'s play, ''[[8 (play)|'8']]'' — a staged reenactment of the [[Perry v. Brown|federal trial]] that overturned California's [[Proposition 8|Prop 8 ban]] on same-sex marriage — as Attorney [[Charles J.

==Personal life==
Bacon has been married to actress [[Kyra Sedgwick]] since September 4, 1988; they met on the set of the [[PBS]] version of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s play ''[[Lemon Sky]]''. He has said &quot;The time I was hitting what I considered to be bottom was also the time I met my wife, our kids were born, good things were happening. And I was able to keep supporting myself; that always gave me strength.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmo91&quot;/&gt;
Bacon and Sedgwick have starred together in ''[[Pyrates]],'' ''[[Murder in the First]]'', ''[[The Woodsman]]'', and ''[[Loverboy (2005 film)|Loverboy]]''. They have two children, Travis Sedgwick Bacon (born June 23, 1989 in Los Angeles, California) and [[Sosie Ruth Bacon]] (born March 15, 1992). The family resides on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].

Bacon has spoken out for the separation of church and state,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.au.org/media/church-and-state/archives/2008/05/two-thumbs-up.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts, The Reliable Source, ''Washington Post'', March 26, 2008. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/25/AR2008032503852.html accessed September 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and told ''[[The Times]]'' in 2005 that he did not &quot;believe in God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I think there is a puritanical wind that is blowing. I have never seen such a lack of separation between church and state in America. I don't believe in God, but if I did I would say that sex is a God-given right.&quot; Wendy Ide, &quot;The Outsider Wants In&quot;, ''The Times'' (London), 1 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has also said that he is not anti-religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,343589,00.html|title=The Bacon Brothers Go 'On the Record'|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon and Sedgwick appeared in [[will.i.am]]'s video [[It's a New Day (song)|&quot;It's a New Day&quot;]], which was released following [[Barack Obama]]'s 2008 presidential win.

Bacon and Sedgwick lost most of their savings in the [[Ponzi scheme]] of infamous fraudulent investor [[Bernard Madoff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;financialpost&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=May 18, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacon confirmed this on Late Show with Craig Ferguson, June 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon and Sedgwick learned in 2011 via their appearance on the PBS TV show ''Finding Your Roots'' with [[Henry Louis Gates]] that he and Sedgwick are 9th cousins, once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/6-degrees-of-separation-k_b_900707.html|title=6 Degrees of Separation: Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon Are Cousins|first=Megan|last=Smolenyak|work=Huffington Post|date=2011-07-18|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This link is wrong. I just watched the show and they are NINTH cousins, not tenth. --&gt;
Bacon and Sedgwick appeared in a video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drawtheline.org/watch-stuff |title=Watch Stuff - Bill of Reproductive Rights |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the &quot;Bill of Reproductive Rights,&quot; supporting among other things a woman's right to choose and access to birth control.
As of November 2012 Bacon is currently starring in adverts for the British mobile and Internet service [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]].

==Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon==
{{Main|Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon}}
Bacon is the subject of the [[trivia]] game titled ''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'', based on the idea that, due to his prolific [[Big screen|screen]] career covering a diverse range of genres, any Hollywood actor can be linked to another in a handful of steps based on their associations with Bacon. The name of the game derives from the idea of [[six degrees of separation]].
Though he was initially dismayed by the game, the [[meme]] stuck, and Bacon eventually embraced it, forming the charitable initiative [[SixDegrees.org]], a social networking site intended to link people and charities to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixdegrees.org/ |title=Six Degrees |accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of proximity to Bacon has been mathematically formalized as the [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon#Bacon numbers|Bacon Index]] and can be referenced at websites including Oracle Of Bacon, which is in turn based upon [[Internet Movie Database]] data. Google even added a feature to their search engine, whereby searching for an actor's name followed by the words 'Bacon Number' will show the ways in which that actor is connected to Kevin Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmonkey.com/2012/09/easter-egg-google-connects-the-dots-for-bacon-number-search/|title=Easter Egg: Google Connects the Dots for ‘Bacon Number’ Search|work=webmonkey|date=2012-09-13|first=Scott|last=Gilbertson|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar measurement exists in the mathematics community where one measures how far one is removed from co-writing a mathematical paper with the famous mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]. This is done by means of the [[Erdős number]] which is 0 for [[Paul Erdős]] himself, 1 for someone who co-wrote an article with him, 2 for someone who co-wrote with someone who co-wrote with him, etc. People have combined the [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon#Bacon numbers|Bacon Index]] and the [[Erdős number]] to form the [[Erdős–Bacon number]], which is essentially the sum of the two.

==Music==
Kevin formed a band called [[The Bacon Brothers]] with his brother, [[Michael Bacon (musician)|Michael]]. The duo has released six [[music album|albums]].

When asked if religion plays a part in her life, in an interview in 2009, Streep replied, &quot;I follow no doctrine.

==Career==
===1970s===
Streep performed in several theater productions in New York and New Jersey after graduating from [[Yale School of Drama]],&lt;ref name=tca&gt;{{cite episode|title=Meryl Streep |series=Inside the Actors Studio |serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] |airdate=1998-11-22 |season=5 |number=1 |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611276/}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] productions of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' with [[Raúl Juliá]], and ''Measure for Measure'' opposite [[Sam Waterston]] and [[John Cazale]]. At this time she entered a relationship with Cazale, with whom she lived until his death three years later. She starred on Broadway in the Brecht/Weill musical ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'', and won an [[Obie Award|Obie]] for her performance in the all-sung off-Broadway production of ''Alice at the Palace''.

[[File:Meryl Streep by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|Streep by [[Jack Mitchell (photographer)|Jack Mitchell]] in the late 1970s]]
Streep began auditioning for film roles, and later recalled an unsuccessful audition for [[Dino De Laurentiis]] for the leading female role in ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]''. De Laurentiis commented to his son in Italian, &quot;She's ugly. Why did you bring me this thing?&quot; and was shocked when Streep replied to the insult in fluent Italian.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepDelayedProjects&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Information, Considered &amp; Delayed Projects |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/site/career/considered/ |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, she appeared in the 1976 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] double bill of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[One act plays by Tennessee Williams#27 Wagons Full of Cotton|27 Wagons Full of Cotton]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. For the former, she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Her other early Broadway credits include [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and the [[Bertolt Brecht]]-[[Kurt Weill]] musical ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'' in which she originally appeared off-Broadway at the [[Chelsea Theater Center]]. She received [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations for both productions.

Streep's first feature film was ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977), in which she played a small but pivotal role during a flashback scene. Streep was living in New York City with Cazale, who had been diagnosed with [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Gray |title=Cinema: A Mother Finds Herself |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948649-3,00.html |work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=3 |date=December 3, 1979 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was cast in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), and Streep was delighted to secure a small role because it allowed her to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. She was not specifically interested in the part, commenting, &quot;They needed a girl between the two guys and I was it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/site/magazines/197902msmagazine/|accessdate=2009-08-14}} citing {{cite journal |work=Ms. Magazine |date=February 1979 |title=Meryl Streep to the Rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She played a leading role in the television [[miniseries]] ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' (1978) as a German woman married to a [[Judaism|Jewish]] artist in [[Nazi era]] Germany. She later explained that she had considered the material to be &quot;unrelentingly noble&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot; /&gt; and had taken the role only because she had needed money.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepHorizonMagazine1978&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197808horizon.htm |accessdate=2009-06-07}} citing {{cite journal |work=Horizon Magazine |date=August 1978 |title=Star Treks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. She spoke of her grief and her hope that work would provide a diversion; she accepted a role in ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979) with [[Alan Alda]], later commenting that she played it on &quot;automatic pilot&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot; /&gt; and performed the role of [[Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)|Katherine]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for [[Shakespeare in the Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/site/career/stage/ |accessdate=2009-06-07}} citing {{cite journal |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=June 1978 |title=From Homecoming Queen to Holocaust}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated audience of 109 million, ''Holocaust'' brought a degree of public recognition to Streep, who was described in August 1978 as &quot;on the verge of national visibility&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepHorizonMagazine1978&quot; /&gt; She won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress&amp;nbsp;– Miniseries or a Movie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/meryl-streep Meryl Streep Emmy Award Winner]&lt;/ref&gt; for her performance.

''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978) was released a month later, and Streep was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.

Streep played a supporting role in ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) for [[Woody Allen]], later stating that she had not seen a complete script and was given only the six pages of her own scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197903lookmagazine.htm |accessdate=2009-06-07}} citing {{cite journal |work=Look Magazine |date=March 1979 |title=Streep Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that she had not been permitted to improvise a word of her dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=89W0QMDjA7gC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Meryl+Streep#PPA76,M1 |title=The Actress: Hollywood Acting and the Female Star |first=Karen |last=Hollinger |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-97792-4 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked to comment on the script for ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'' (1979), in a meeting with the producer Stan Jaffee, director [[Robert Benton]] and star [[Dustin Hoffman]], Streep insisted that the female character was not representative of many real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles, and was written as &quot;too evil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot; /&gt; Jaffee, Benton and Hoffman agreed with Streep, and the script was revised.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot; /&gt; In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a mother and housewife with a career,&lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and frequented the [[Upper East Side]] neighborhood in which the film was set.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepMsMagazine1979&quot; /&gt; Benton allowed Streep to write her dialogue in two of her key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman.&lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, &quot;She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive.

Streep drew critical acclaim for her performance in each of her three films released in 1979: the [[romantic comedy]] ''Manhattan'', the political drama ''The Seduction of Joe Tynan'' and the family drama, ''Kramer vs. Kramer''.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; She was awarded the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress]], [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her collective work in the three films.

===1980s===
[[File:Meryl Streep 1989.jpg|thumb|right|Streep at the [[61st Academy Awards]], 1989]]

After prominent supporting roles in two of the 1970s' most successful films, the consecutive winners of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' and ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', and praise for her versatility in several supporting roles, Streep progressed to leading roles. Her first was ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981). A [[story within a story]] drama, the film paired Streep with [[Jeremy Irons]] as contemporary actors, telling their modern story as well as the [[Victorian era]] drama they were performing. A ''[[New York Magazine]]'' article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a &quot;[[chameleon]]&quot;, willing to play any type of role.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkMagazineSep1981&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Denby |first=David |title=Meryl Streep is Madonna and siren in ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' |work=New York Magazine |date=1981-09-21 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-OUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Meryl+Streep&amp;lr=#PPA26,M1 |accessdate=2009-06-15|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep was awarded a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her work.

Her next film, the [[psychological thriller]], ''[[Still of the Night (film)|Still of the Night]]'' (1982) reunited her with Robert Benton, the director of ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', and co-starred [[Roy Scheider]] and [[Jessica Tandy]]. [[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted that the film was an homage to the works of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep &quot;is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title='Still of the Night', in Hitchcock Manner |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1985-09-20 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D8123BF93AA25752C1A964948260 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Poland|Polish]] [[holocaust survivor]] in ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; [[William Styron]] wrote the novel with [[Ursula Andress]] in mind for the part of Sophie, but Streep was very determined to get the role. After she obtained a pirated copy of the script, she went to [[Alan J. Pakula]] and threw herself on the ground begging him to give her the part..&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Streep filmed the &quot;choice&quot; scene in one take and refused to do it again, as she found shooting the scene extremely painful and emotionally exhausting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Makes Meryl Magic |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924815-8,00.html |accessdate=2009-06-15 |date=1981-09-07 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | first=John | last=Skow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among several notable acting awards, Streep won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance. [[Roger Ebert]] said of her performance, &quot;Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

She followed this success with a biographical film, ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), in which she played her first real-life character, the [[Labor union|union activist]] [[Karen Silkwood]]. She discussed her preparation for the role in an interview with [[Roger Ebert]] and said that she had met with people close to Silkwood to learn more about her, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of Silkwood.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger|last=Ebert |coauthor=David Bordwell|title=Awake in the dark: the best of Roger Ebert: forty years of reviews, essays, and interviews |url=http://books.google.com/?id=YIU1jlgPjr8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Meryl+Streep#PPA64,M1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-226-18200-2 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep concentrated on the events of Silkwood's life and concluded, &quot;I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot; /&gt;

Her next films were a [[romantic drama]], ''[[Falling in Love (1984 film)|Falling in Love]]'' (1984) opposite [[Robert De Niro]], and a British drama, ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]'' (1985). Roger Ebert said of Streep's performance in ''Plenty'' that she conveyed &quot;great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title='Plenty' review |work=Chicago Sun Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850920/REVIEWS/509200303/1023 |date=1982-11-19 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) starred Streep as the Danish writer [[Karen Blixen]] and co-starred [[Robert Redford]]. A significant critical success, the film received a 63% &quot;fresh&quot; rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Out of Africa (1985) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/out_of_africa/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep co-starred with [[Jack Nicholson]] in her next two films, the dramas ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' (1986) and ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'' (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the television movie, ''Secret Service'', in 1977. In ''[[Evil Angels (film)|A Cry in the Dark]]'', aka ''Evil Angels'' (1988), she played the biographical role of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], an Australian woman who had been convicted of the [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|murder of her infant daughter]] despite Chamberlain claiming the baby had been taken by a [[dingo]] (a claim that was later vindicated). Filmed in Australia, Streep won the [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]], a [[Prix d'interprétation féminine|Best Actress]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] and was nominated for several other awards for her portrayal of Chamberlain. 

In ''[[She-Devil (film)|She-Devil]]'' (1989), Streep played her first comedic film role, opposite [[Roseanne Barr]]. Richard Corliss, writing for ''Time,'' commented that Streep was the &quot;one reason&quot; to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the type of role for which she had been known, saying, &quot;Surprise! Inside the [[Greer Garson]] roles Streep usually plays, a vixenish [[Carole Lombard]] is screaming to be cut loose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Warty Worm, &quot;She-Devil&quot; review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959340,00.html |work=Time magazine |date=1989-12-11 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
[[File:Jeff y Meryl Streep.jpg|left|thumb|Meryl Streep at the [[32nd Grammy Awards]] in 1990.]]
In the 1990s, Streep continued to choose a great variety of roles. From 1984 to 1990, she won six [[People's Choice Awards]] for Favorite Motion Picture Actress, and in 1990 was named World Favorite. Biographer Karen Hollinger described this period as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingerp78&quot;&gt;p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingerp78&quot; /&gt; a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, &quot;By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkMagazineSep1981&quot; /&gt;

Streep played a drug-addicted movie actress in a screen adaptation of [[Carrie Fisher]]'s novel ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'', with [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]]. Streep and [[Goldie Hawn]] had established a friendship and were interested in making a film together. After considering various projects, they decided upon ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'', until Streep's pregnancy coincided with the filming schedule, and the producers decided to proceed with [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Geena Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SimplyStreepDelayedProjects&quot; /&gt; They subsequently filmed the farcical black comedy, ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'', with [[Bruce Willis]] as their co-star. ''Time'''s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's &quot;wicked-witch routine&quot; but dismissed the film as &quot;''She-Devil'' with a make-over&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Beverly Hills Corpse, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976129,00.html |work=Time magazine |date=1992-08-03 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Streep played opposite [[Clint Eastwood]] in the love story ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995). Based on a best-selling novel by [[Robert James Waller]],&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p.492&lt;/ref&gt; it relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife in [[Iowa]] named Francesca (Streep). Streep and Eastwood got along famously during production and such was their on-screen chemistry that a number of people believed that the two were having an affair off-camera, although this was denied by both.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan 1999, p.499&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p.499&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a hit at the box office and grossed $70 million in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan, p.503&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p.503&lt;/ref&gt; The film, unlike the novel, surprised film critics and was warmly received. Janet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Clint had managed to create &quot;a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill&quot;, while [[Joe Morgenstern]] of the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described ''The Bridges of Madison County'' as &quot;one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan, p.503&quot; /&gt;

In 1996, Streep starred as Lee in ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'', an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. [[Diane Keaton]] played her estranged sister Bessie, a woman battling [[leukemia]], although Streep had initially been considered for the role. The film also starred a young [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Streep's rebellious son. [[Roger Ebert]] stated that &quot;Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ebert. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970110/REVIEWS/701100302/1023 Review- ''Marvin's Room'']. January 10, 1997. Retrieved March 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critically acclaimed, the film was not released on a wide scale. Streep, however, earned another Golden Globe nomination for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, Streep portrayed [[Roberta Guaspari]], a real-life New Yorker who found passion and enlightenment teaching violin to inner-city kids in [[East Harlem]], in the music drama ''[[Music of the Heart]]''. A departure from director [[Wes Craven]]’s previous work on films like ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' series, Streep replaced singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, four to six hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifewhile.com/news/136587/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
{{main|Meryl Streep in the 2000s}}

Streep entered the 2000s with [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', a [[science fiction film]] about a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]], played by [[Haley Joel Osment]], uniquely programmed with the ability to love, voicing the [[Blue Fairy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' (2001)|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ai.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] concert with [[Liam Neeson]] which was held in [[Oslo, Norway]] on December 11, 2001 in honour of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, the [[United Nations]] and [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Concerts (2001)|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/concert/history/2001.php|publisher=Nobelpeaceprize.org|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Streep returned to the stage for the first time in more than twenty years, playing Arkadina in [[The Public Theater]]'s revival of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'', directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and co-starring [[Kevin Kline]], [[Natalie Portman]], and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ben|last=Brantley|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/13/theater/theater-review-streep-meets-chekhov-up-in-central-park.html?src=pm|title=Theater Review: Streep Meets Chekhov, Up in Central Park|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2001-08-31|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she began work on [[Spike Jonze]]'s comedy-drama ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' (2002), in which she portrayed real-life journalist [[Susan Orlean]].

Focusing on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], the film was generally well received and won all three leading actresses a [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Meryl Streep in St-Petersburg 2.jpg|thumb|Streep in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] in 2004.]] The following year, Streep had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as herself in the [[Farrelly brothers]] comedy ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]'' (2003) and reunited with [[Mike Nichols]] to star with [[Al Pacino]] and [[Emma Thompson]] in the [[HBO]] adaptation of [[Tony Kushner]]'s six-hour play ''[[Angels in America (miniseries)|Angels in America]]'', the story of two couples whose relationships dissolve amidst the backdrop of [[Reagan Era]] politics.

Streep was next cast in the 2005 comedy ''[[Prime (film)|Prime]]'', directed by [[Ben Younger]]. In the film, she played Lisa Metzger, the [[Jew]]ish psychoanalyst of a divorced and lonesome business-woman, played by [[Uma Thurman]], who enters a relationship with Metzger's 23-year-old son ([[Bryan Greenberg]]).

Also in 2006, Streep, along with [[Lily Tomlin]], portrayed the last two members of what was once a popular family [[country music]] act in [[Robert Altman]]'s final film ''[[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]]''.

In 2007, Streep was cast in four films. She portrayed a wealthy university patron in [[Chen Shi-zheng]]'s much-delayed feature drama ''[[Dark Matter (film)|Dark Matter]]'' (2007), a film about a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired by the events of the 1991 [[University of Iowa shooting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23189744/ns/today-entertainment/|title=Streep Film Delayed Because Of Campus Shooting|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2011-02-17|date=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve ''Dark Matter'' out of respect for the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dalya|last=Alberge|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article1706612.ece/|title=Campus Massacre Films Face A Ban|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2011-02-17|date=2007-04-26|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark_matter/ |title=''Dark Matter'' (2007)|accessdate=2008-04-11|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian [[foreign national]] suspected of [[terrorism]] in the political thriller ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]'' (2007), directed by [[Gavin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markon|first=Jerry|title=Lawsuit Against CIA Is Dismissed|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/18/AR2006051802107.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-05-19|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep Plays With Politics|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nerer1qI-zQ|work=Artisan News Service|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2007-11-12|accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, ''Rendition'' was less commercially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rendition'' (2007)|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rendition.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rendition/|title=''Rendition'' (2007)|accessdate=2011-02-11|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Streep had a short role alongside [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Glenn Close]] and her eldest daughter [[Mamie Gummer]] in [[Lajos Koltai]]'s drama film ''[[Evening (film)|Evening]]'', based on the 1998 novel of the same name by [[Susan Minot]]. Switching between the present and the past, it tells the story of a bedridden woman, who remembers her tumultuous life in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/danesdancygummer.htm|title=Some Enchanted Evening|work=Pop Entertainment|accessdate=2011-02-17|date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released to lukewarm reactions by critics, who called it &quot;beautifully filmed, but decidedly dull [and] a colossal waste of a talented cast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evening/|title=''Evening'' (2007)|accessdate=2011-02-11|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Evening'' (2007)|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evening.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep's last film of 2007 was [[Robert Redford]]s ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', a film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in [[Afghanistan]], a U.S. senator, a reporter, and a California college professor.

In 2008, Streep found major commercial success when she starred in [[Phyllida Lloyd]]'s ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'', a [[film adaptation]] of the [[Mamma Mia!|musical of the same name]], based on the songs of Swedish [[pop music|pop]] group [[ABBA]]. Co-starring [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]] and [[Colin Firth]], Streep played a single mother and a former girl-group singer, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding on an idyllic Greek island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Mamma Mia!'' Unfazed By The Fuss In Skopelos|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2008-07-15|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/artsandculture/2229868/Mamma-Mia---Unfazed-by-the-fuss-in-Skopelos.html|first=Paul|last=Mansfield|accessdate=2010-05-12|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; An instant box office success, ''Mamma Mia!'' became Streep's highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mammamia.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=''Mamma Mia!''

Streep's other film of 2008 was ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' featuring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Amy Adams]], and [[Viola Davis]]. A drama revolving around the stern principal nun (Streep) of a [[Bronx]] [[Catholic school]] in 1964 who brings charges of [[pedophilia]] against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doubt.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=''Doubt'' (2008)|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was hailed by many critics as one of the best of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.metacritic.com/film/awards/2008/toptens.shtml|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|title=Film Critic Top Ten List: 2008 Critics' Picks|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, Streep played chef [[Julia Child]] in [[Nora Ephron]]'s ''[[Julie &amp; Julia]]'', co-starring Amy Adams and Stanley Tucci. The first major motion picture based on a blog, it contrasts the life of Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker [[Julie Powell]] (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' in 365 days, a challenge she described on her popular [[blog]], ''The Julie/Julia Project'', that would make her a published author. The same year, Streep also starred in [[Nancy Meyers]]' romantic comedy ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'', with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Steve Martin]]. She also received nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for both of these films and won the award for the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/nominations/year/2009/ |title=Golden Globe Awards 2009|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |date= |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep later received her 16th Oscar nomination for ''Julie &amp; Julia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Gans  | first = Andrew | title = Academy Award Nominations Announced Feb. 2; &quot;Nine&quot; Receives Four Noms | work = Playbill.com | date = 2010-02-02 | url = http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136504-Academy-Award-Nominations-Announced-Feb-2-Nine-Receives-Four-Noms | accessdate = 2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also lent her voice to Mrs. Felicity Fox in the stop-motion film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]''.

===2010s===
[[File:Meryl Streep Crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Streep at the [[69th Golden Globe Awards]] in January 2012.]]
Streep's first film of the 2010s was [[Phyllida Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'' (2011), a British [[biographical film]] about [[Margaret Thatcher]], which takes a look at the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] during the [[Falklands War]] and her years in retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Peck |title=Meryl Streep takes on her toughest role: the Iron Lady |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/meryl-streep-takes-on-her-toughest-role-the-iron-lady-2016400.html |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2011-01-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep, who sat through a session at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to observe  British [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s in action in preparation for her role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meryl Streep attends parliament for Thatcher research|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/meryl-streep-attends-parliament-for-thatcher-research-2189672.html |work=The Independent |location=UK|date=2011-01-12|accessdate=2012-02-29|first=Bang|last=Showbiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; called her cast &quot;a daunting and exciting challenge,&quot; and further added: &quot;I am trying to approach the role with as much zeal, fervour and attention to detail as the real Lady Thatcher possesses – I can only hope my stamina will begin to approach her own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Image of Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher unveiled |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12393674 |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film had a mixed reception, Streep's performance got rave reviews, earning her Best Actress awards at the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globes]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTAs]] as well as her third win at the [[84th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/2012-GOLDEN-GLOBES-Are-Tonight-BroadwayWorld-to-Update-Winners-LIVE-20120115 2012 GOLDEN GLOBES Nominees and Winners - Complete List!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/02/12/bafta-winners-announced-2/ BAFTA winners announced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/02/26/2012-oscar-winners/ Oscars winners list: 'The Artist,' Jean Dujardin, and Meryl Streep take home top awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Streep reunited with David Frankel on the set of the [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[Hope Springs (2012 film)|Hope Springs]]'', co-starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Steve Carell]]. In it, Streep and Jones play a middle-aged couple, who attend a week of intensive marriage counseling to try to bring back the intimacy missing in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Gets Sex Right, For Once: The Surprisingly Honest Hope Springs|url=http://gawker.com/5932701/what-the-surprisingly-honest-hope-springs-gets-right-about-sex|work=[[Gawker]]|date=2012-08-07|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising the &quot;mesmerizing performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones&quot; which offer &quot;filmgoers some grown-up laughs -- and a thoughtful look at mature relationships&quot;. She earned her 27th [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] nomination for her role, breaking her own record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hope Springs (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hope_springs_2012/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streep will star alongside [[Julia Roberts]] in the upcoming film ''[[August: Osage County (film)|August: Osage County]]'', which is being filmed on-site in [[Oklahoma]] as of September 2012 and is slated for release in mid-2013. The film is based on [[Tracy Letts]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning [[August: Osage County|play of the same name]] and is being directed by [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]]. In September 2012, it was reported that Streep along with [[Hilary Swank]] will join the production of ''The Homesman'', Tommy Lee Jones' sophomore{{what|date=February 2013}} directorial effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep &amp; Hilary Swank Team For 'The Homesman'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/meryl-streep-hilary-swank-team-for-the-homesman-while-streep-tina-fey-pic-mommy-me-falls-apart-20120927/|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|date=2012-09-27|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, numerous reports surfaced that Streep has been cast as the Witch in a film adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCOOP: Meryl Streep to Play the Witch in INTO THE WOODS Film; Arranger David Krane Confirms!|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/SCOOP-Meryl-Streep-to-Play-the-Witch-in-INTO-THE-WOODS-Film-Arranger-David-Krane-Confirms-20130131|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roxbury Composer's Future: New Town, Working with Meryl Streep as a Witch|url=http://www.countytimes.com/articles/2013/01/31/entertainment/doc510959d3e6ffa160222903.txt|publisher=Litchfield Country Times|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep Will Head Into The Woods With Rob Marshall|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Meryl-Streep-Head-Woods-With-Rob-Marshall-35460.html|publisher=Cinema Blenda|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accents and dialects==
Streep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents,&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; from Danish in ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985); to English [[Received pronunciation|Standard English]] in ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]'' (also 1985), ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'' (2011); and from Italian in ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995); to a Minnesota accent in ''[[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (2006) and from Irish-American in ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'' to a heavy Bronx accent in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''.  In ''[[Evil Angels (film)|A Cry in the Dark]]'' (1988), critics were impressed with Streep's ability to master an Australian accent with shades of New Zealand English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trial by fury |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/22/1100972318463.html | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For her role in the film ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), she spoke in a Polish accent, and took language courses as the role required her to speak both German and Polish fluently in key scenes. In ''The Iron Lady'', she reproduced the vocal style of [[Margaret Thatcher]], from the time before she became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation and delivery. Despite the accolades accorded to her, Streep has emphasised that adopting accents is an element she simply considers an obvious part of creating a character.  When asked whether accents helped her get into character, she responded, &quot;I'm always baffled by this question... How could I play that part and talk like me?&quot; When questioned as to how she reproduces different accents, Streep replied, &quot;I listen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter (20 August 2007) [http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/oscar_winner_boosts_new_arts_centre_plan_1_1857735 Oscar winner boosts new arts centre plan]. Johnston Publishing. Retrieved on: 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
After Streep appeared in ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'', her rendition of the song &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; rose to popularity in the Portuguese music charts, where it peaked at #8 in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Portuguese Music Charts|url=http://acharts.us/portugal_singles_top_50/2008/43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[35th People's Choice Awards]], her version of ''Mamma Mia'' won an award for &quot;Favorite Song From A Soundtrack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=People Choice Awards Results |url=http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/awards/nominees/index.jsp?year=2009 | publisher = [[People's Choice Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Streep was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] (her fifth nomination) for her work on the ''Mamma Mia!'' soundtrack.

==Philanthropy==
Streep is the spokesperson for the National Women's History Museum, to which she has donated a significant amount of money (including her fee for ''The Iron Lady'') and hosted numerous events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhm.org/about-nwhm/press/featured-press/meryl-streep/|title=About|publisher=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2012, Streep donated $1 million dollars to [[The Public Theater]] in honor of both its late founder, [[Joseph Papp]], and her friend, the author [[Nora Ephron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep donates $1M to The Public Theatre|url=http://news.yahoo.com/meryl-streep-donates-1m-public-theatre-163830911.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also supports [[Gucci]]'s &quot;Chime For Change&quot; campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karmali|first=Sarah|title=Beyoncé Leads New Gucci Empowerment Campaign|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/02/28/beyonce-knowles-salma-hayek-gucci-chime-for-change-campaign-frida-giannini|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dustin Lee Hoffman'''&lt;ref name=cabi&gt;According to the State of California ([[California Birth Index|CA Birth Index]]).

Retrieved January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (born August 8, 1937)&lt;ref name=cabi /&gt; is an [[United States|American]] actor with a career in film, television, and theatre since 1960. He has been known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and vulnerable characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.biography.com/articles/Dustin-Hoffman-9341124|publisher=Biography.com|title=Dustin Hoffman Biography|accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first drew critical praise for the play ''[[Eh?]]'', for which he won a [[Theatre World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]]. This was soon followed by his breakthrough 1967 film role as Benjamin Braddock, the title character in ''[[The Graduate]]''. Since then Hoffman's career has largely been focused on cinema, with sporadic returns to television and the stage. His most notable films include ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)| Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[Papillon (film)|Papillon]]'', ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', ''[[Tootsie]]'', ''[[Rain Man]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' and ''[[Wag the Dog]]''.

Hoffman has been nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s, winning two (for his performances in ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'' and ''[[Rain Man]]''), thirteen [[Golden Globe|Golden Globes]], winning six (including an honorary one) and has won four [[BAFTA]]s, three [[Drama Desk Awards]], a [[Genie Award]], and an [[Emmy Award]]. Hoffman received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1999, and the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2012.

Hoffman had his directorial debut in 2012, with ''[[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]''.

==Early life==
Hoffman was born in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name=cabi /&gt; the second son of Lillian (née Gold) and Harry Hoffman. His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at [[Columbia Pictures]] before becoming a furniture salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800014129/bio |title=Yahoo movies biography |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/82/Dustin-Hoffman.html |title=Film Reference.com biography |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor [[Dustin Farnum]].

==Career==
===Early work===
Hoffman began his acting career at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], alongside future Academy Award-winner [[Gene Hackman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 50-Year Hoffman-Hackman History|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/movies/film-the-50-year-hoffman-hackman-history.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York Times|date=October 12, 2003|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following. During this time period, he got an occasional bit television role, but left acting briefly to teach in order to support himself. Hoffman also occasionally performed television commercials; an oft-replayed{{cn|date=September 2012}} segment on programs that explore actors' early work is a clip showing Hoffman touting the [[Volkswagen Type 3|Volkswagen Fastback]].

In 1960, Hoffman was cast in a role in an [[Off-Broadway]] production and followed with a [[Bit part|walk-on role]] in a Broadway production in 1961. Hoffman then studied at [[Actors Studio]] and became a dedicated [[method acting|method actor]]. [[Sidney W. Pink]], a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered him in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in ''[[Madigan's Millions]]''. His first critical success was in ''[[Eh?]]'' by [[Henry Livings]], which had its US premiere at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle in the Square Downtown]] on October 16, 1966.

Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'' and ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]''.

Hoffman made his theatrical film debut in ''[[The Tiger Makes Out]]'' in 1967, alongside [[Eli Wallach]].  In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on ''The Tiger Makes Out'', Hoffman flew from New York City to [[Fargo, North Dakota]], where he directed productions of [[William_Gibson_(playwright)|William Gibson]]'s ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' and [[William Saroyan]]'s ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' for the Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/post_graduate_ak58eN30oOfHC866kVDsxH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i4010e1eda0d0746c31d2b72b72ed30f6&lt;/ref&gt; The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

===Major roles===
[[File:Hoffman-Bancroft-the-graduate.jpg|thumb|Hoffman being seduced by [[Anne Bancroft]] in ''The Graduate'' (1967)]]
In 1967, director [[Mike Nichols]] cast Hoffman in ''[[The Graduate]]'', his first major role, for which he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for his performance. Hoffman played the character of Benjamin Braddock, who returns to his wealthy parents' home in California after graduating college. Confused about what to do with his life, he is seduced into having an affair with Mrs. Robinson, an alcoholic and a neurotic, and the wife of his father's business partner. 

Although ''Life'' magazine joked that &quot;[i]f Dustin Hoffman's face were his fortune, he'd be committed to a life of poverty&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;life19671124&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=The Graduate | work=Life | date=1967-11-24 | accessdate=February 21, 2013 | author=Zeitlin, David | pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Graduate'' was a gigantic box-office hit for [[Embassy Pictures]], making Hoffman a major new star at the same time. The film, mostly due to Hoffman's acting, received near unanimously good reviews. ''Time'' magazine called Hoffman &quot;a symbol of youth&quot; who represented &quot;a new breed of actors.&quot; According to Hoffman biographer and film historian Jeff Lenburg, &quot;newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans,&quot; including one published in the ''New York Times'':&lt;ref name=Lenburg/&gt;

{{quote|I identified with Ben…I thought of him as a spiritual brother. He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am. It's a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lenburg&gt;Lenburg, Jeff. ''Dustin Hoffman: Hollywood's Antihero'', St. Martin's Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}}}}

''[[Turner Classic Movies]]'' critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented &quot;a new generation of actors.&quot; He credits Hoffman with breaking &quot;the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nixon&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18530/The-Graduate/articles.html ''The Graduate''], ''Turner Classic Movies''&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman's career:

{{quote|In ''The Graduate'', he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.&lt;ref name=Nixon/&gt;}}

In December 1968, Hoffman returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of [[Murray Schisgal]] and [[John Sebastian]]'s musical ''[[Jimmy Shine]]''. For his performance in the production, Hoffman won a [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Performance. Just a few weeks after leaving the production, Hoffman's next major film, ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', premiered in theatres across the United States on May 25, 1969. For his role as Ratso Rizzo in the film, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] honor. This was followed by his role in [[Little Big Man (film)|''Little Big Man'']] (1970) where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for [[Chief Dan George]].

Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. ''[[Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?]]'' (1971), ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (also 1971), and ''[[Papillon (film)|Papillon]]'' (1973) were followed by ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' (1974), for which Hoffman received his third nomination for Best Actor in seven years.

Less than two years after the [[Watergate scandal]], Hoffman and [[Robert Redford]] starred as [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], respectively, in ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976). Hoffman next starred in ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (also 1976), a film based on [[William Goldman]]'s novel of the same name, opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Roy Scheider]]. Hoffman's next roles were less successful. He opted out of directing ''[[Straight Time]]'' (1978), but starred as a thief. His next film, [[Michael Apted]]'s ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'', was with [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Agatha Christie]].

Hoffman next starred in [[Robert Benton]]'s ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'' (1979) as workaholic Ted Kramer whose wife ([[Meryl Streep]]) unexpectedly leaves him; he raises their son alone. Hoffman gained his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep) and Director.

In ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera. His co-star was [[Jessica Lange]]. ''[[Tootsie]]'' earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman's fifth nomination.

[[File:Dustin Hoffman on Set.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hoffman on the set of ''Lenny'' (1974)]]
In 1984, Hoffman starred as [[Willy Loman]] in the Broadway revival of the 1949 [[Arthur Miller]] play, ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=950ce2d81e39f933a05750c0a962948260 |last=Rich | first=Frank | authorlink= Frank Rich| title=Hoffman: Death of Salesman| work= The New York Times | date=March 30, 1984| accessdate= February 21, 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; a role he reprised in a [[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|TV movie of the same name]], for which he won the 1985 [[Emmy Award]] in the category of Outstanding Lead Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries. He also went on to win a [[Golden Globe]] for the same performance.

Hoffman's worst film failure was Elaine May's ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', with [[Warren Beatty]]. The film faced severe production problems, received almost completely negative reviews from critics and was nominated for three [[Razzie]] awards. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film's final cut and tried to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1546217 |title=A Conversation with Dustin Hoffman |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |publisher=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,316589_7|7005|0_0_,00.html |title=Warren Pieces |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |date=December 20, 1991 |work=Entertainment Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and ''Ishtar'' became a [[cult film]]. [[James House (singer)|James House]], who later became a [[country music]] artist, served as Hoffman's vocal coach in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/James-House.html |title=James House Biography |publisher= Oldies.Com |date=March 21, 1955 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In director Barry Levinson's ''[[Rain Man]]'' (1988), Hoffman starred as an [[autism|autistic]] [[savant syndrome|savant]], opposite [[Tom Cruise]]. Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman's performance gained him his second Academy Award. Upon accepting, Hoffman stated softly to his fellow nominees that it was okay if they didn't vote for him because &quot;I didn't vote for you guys either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/oscars?blend=1&amp;ob=4&amp;rclk=cti#p/u/16/ErqHXzhSuv4|title=Dustin Hoffman winning an Oscar for &quot;Rain Man |accessdate= January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''Rain Man'', Hoffman appeared with [[Sean Connery]] and [[Matthew Broderick]] in ''[[Family Business (film)|Family Business]]''. The film did relatively poorly with the critics and at the box office. In 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Lisa's Substitute]]&quot;, under the pseudonym Sam Etic. As a reference to this episode, during the episode featuring the [[Itchy &amp; Scratchy]] movie, Lisa claims that Dustin Hoffman had a cameo in that movie but didn't use his real name.

Throughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990) (where his ''Ishtar'' co-star Beatty plays the titular character), ''[[Hero (1992 film)|Hero]]'' (1992) and ''[[Billy Bathgate (film)|Billy Bathgate]]'' (1991) co-starring with [[Nicole Kidman]] who was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]). Hoffman also played the title role of [[Captain Hook]] in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (also 1991), earning a [[Golden Globe]] nomination; in this movie, Hoffman's costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it. Hoffman played the lead role in ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' (1995), alongside [[Rene Russo]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. Following that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge-drama/legal-thriller ''[[Sleepers (film)|Sleepers]]'' (1996) with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Jason Patric]], and [[Kevin Bacon]].
[[File:Dustin Hoffman in Last Chance Harvey.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoffman during the filming of ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' in 2008]]

In the mid-1990s, Hoffman starred in—and was deeply involved in the production of—[[David Mamet]]'s ''[[American Buffalo (film)|American Buffalo]]'' (also 1996), and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford. In 1997, Hoffman starred opposite [[John Travolta]] in the [[Costa Gavras]] film ''[[Mad City (film)|Mad City]]'' and gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in ''[[Wag The Dog]]'', in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Denis Leary]]. He next appeared in Barry Levinson's adaptation of ''[[Sphere (film)|Sphere]]'' (1998), opposite [[Sharon Stone]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Liev Schreiber]]. Hoffman next appeared in ''[[Moonlight Mile (film)|Moonlight Mile]]'' (2002), followed by ''[[Confidence (2003 film)|Confidence]]'' (2003) opposite [[Edward Burns]], [[Andy García]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Hoffman finally had a chance to work with [[Gene Hackman]] in [[Gary Fleder]]'s ''[[Runaway Jury]]'' (also 2003), an adaptation of [[John Grisham]]'s bestselling novel.

Hoffman played theater owner [[Charles Frohman]] in the [[J. M. Barrie]] historical fantasia ''[[Finding Neverland]]'' (2004), costarring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Kate Winslet]]. In director [[David O. Russell]]'s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite [[Lily Tomlin]] as an [[existentialism |existential]] detective team member.

Seven years after his nomination for ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', Hoffman got a second opportunity to perform again with [[Robert De Niro]], co-starring with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Ben Stiller]] in the 2004 comedy ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'', a sequel to ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2005, he voiced a horse in ''[[Racing Stripes]]'', and appeared in cameo roles in [[Andy García]]'s ''[[The Lost City (2005 film)|The Lost City]]'' and on the final episode of [[HBO]] sitcom ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'''s fifth season. Hoffman appeared in ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in [[Tom Tykwer]]'s film ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'' (also 2006), and had a cameo in the same year's ''[[The Holiday]]''.

In 2007, he was featured in an advertising campaign for Australian telecommunications company [[Telstra]]'s Next G network,&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, Matt. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/rap-for-telstra-over-ad-promise/2007/08/24/1187462526624.html &quot;Rap for Telstra over ad promise&quot;], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the [[50 Cent]] video &quot;Follow My Lead&quot; as a psychiatrist, and played the title character in the family film ''[[Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium]]''. In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated film, Hoffman had a prominent role as [[Shifu]] in the acclaimed film ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with [[Jack Black]] (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character's poignantly complex relationship with the story's villain. He later won the [[Annie Award]] for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for ''Kung Fu Panda'' and has continued into the role in the franchise's subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise's [[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness|television series]]. He next voiced Roscuro in ''[[The Tale of Despereaux (film)|The Tale of Despereaux]]'' and played the title character in ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]''.

He appeared in ''[[Little Fockers]]'', the critically panned yet hugely commercially successful 2010 sequel to ''[[Meet the Fockers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/dustin-hoffman-hears-the-cry-of-the-multitudes-rea,44528/?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feeds&amp;utm_source=avclub_rss_daily |title=Dustin Hoffman hears the cry of the multitudes, realizes there is no Little Fockers without him |publisher=The A.V.

[[File:Dustin Hoffman Quartet avp 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Hoffman in Paris at the French premiere of  ''[[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]'', March 2013.]]
Hoffman starred in the [[HBO]] horse-racing drama ''[[Luck (TV Series)|Luck]]'', as a man involved in bookmaking and casino operations. ''Luck'' was cancelled in March 2012 after three horses died on set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 15–21, 2010|title=Casting Call|journal=TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman also directed ''[[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]'', a [[BBC Films]] comedy starring [[Maggie Smith]] and [[Tom Courtenay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10121046.stm |title= Hoffman to take director's chair for British comedy|date= May 18, 2010 |work=BBC News  |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hoffman's audiobook recording of [[Jerzy Kosinski]]'s ''[[Being There (novel)]]'' was released at [[Audible.com]].  His performance was nominated for a 2013 [[Audie Award]] for Best Solo Narration - Male.

Hoffman had a starring role in three films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture: ''Midnight Cowboy'', ''Kramer v Kramer'', and ''Rain Man''. Clark Gable is the only other actor to achieve this feat.

In addition to a career in film, he has also enjoyed a successful career on stage, winning [[Tony Awards]] for ''[[Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?]]'' and ''[[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]]''.

He is a [[Method acting|method]] actor, taught mainly by [[Lee Strasberg]] and Charles Laughton at the [[Actors Studio]] in New York.

Although he has never married, Pacino has had several relationships with actresses and has three children.

== Early life and education ==

Pacino was born in [[East Harlem]], New York City, to [[Italian American]] parents Salvatore Pacino and Rose, who divorced when he was two years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/al-pacino.html;jsessionid=72608322139F4D260A9749A6DAAEB849.public1? |title=Al Pacino Biography|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|location=UK |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was two, his mother moved to a neighborhood in the Bronx near the [[Bronx Zoo]], to live with her parents, Kate and James Gelardi, who originally came from [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Inside the Actors Studio]] |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] |airdate=October 2, 2006 |season=12 |number=20 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Salvatore (whose father Alfio originally came from [[San Fratello]], [[Sicily]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/aprile/13/Sui_Nebrodi_carnevale_della_Settimana_co_0_0104133550.shtml Felice Cavallaro, ''Sui Nebrodi il carnevale della Settimana Santa'', [[Corriere della Sera]], 13 April 2001 (Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;) moved to [[Covina, California]], and worked as an insurance salesman and restaurateur.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; 

During his teenage years &quot;Sonny&quot;, as he was known to his friends, aimed to become a [[baseball]] player, though he was also nicknamed &quot;The Actor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; Pacino flunked nearly all of his classes except [[English studies|English]] and dropped out of school at 17. His mother disagreed with his decision; they had an argument and he left home. He worked at a string of low-paying jobs, including messenger, [[busboy]], [[janitor]], and postal clerk, in order to finance his acting studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt;

He started smoking at age nine, drinking, and casual [[marijuana]] use at age thirteen, but never took [[Hard and soft drugs|hard drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His two closest friends died young of [[drug abuse]] at the ages of 19 and 30.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in The Bronx, he got into occasional fights and was something of a troublemaker at school.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground but was rejected for the [[Actors Studio]] while still a teenager.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; Pacino then joined the Herbert Berghof Studio ([[HB Studio]]), where he met teacher of acting Charlie Laughton{{spaced ndash}}not the English actor [[Charles Laughton]]{{spaced ndash}}who became his mentor and best friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; During this period, he was frequently unemployed and [[homeless]], and sometimes had to sleep on the street, in theaters, or at friends' houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, his mother died at the age of 43.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, his grandfather, James Gelardi, one of the most influential people in his life, also died.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt;

== Actors Studio training ==

After having spent four years at HB Studio, Pacino successfully auditioned for the Actors Studio.&lt;ref name=page&gt;Grobel; p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; The Actors Studio is a membership organization for professional actors, [[theatre direction|theatre directors]] and playwrights in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=official /&gt; Pacino studied &quot;[[method acting]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; under acting coach [[Lee Strasberg]], who later appeared with Pacino in the films ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and in ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

During later interviews he spoke about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. &quot;The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves&amp;nbsp;... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

During another interview he added, &quot;It was exciting to work for him [Lee Strasberg] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before&amp;nbsp;... He had such a great understanding&amp;nbsp;... he loved actors so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipton&quot;&gt;Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Dutton (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacino is currently co-president, along with [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Harvey Keitel]], of the Actors Studio.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theactorsstudio.org/studio-history/ |title= Actors Studio History by Andreas Manolikakis |publisher=Actors Studio Official Website |accessdate=July 26, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100725161250/http://www.theactorsstudio.org/studio-history/| archivedate= July 25, 2010 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage career ==

In 1967, Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in [[Boston]], performing in [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[Awake and Sing!]]'' (his first major paycheck: $125 a week); and in Jean-Claude Van Itallie's ''America, Hurrah'', where he met actress [[Jill Clayburgh]] while working on this play. They went on to have a five-year romance and moved together back to New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;Yule, A. ''Al Pacino: Life on the Wire'', Time Warner Paperbacks (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Pacino starred in [[Israel Horovitz]]'s ''[[The Indian Wants the Bronx]]'' at the Astor Place Theater, playing Murph, a street punk. The play opened January 17, 1968, and ran for 177 performances; it was staged in a double bill with Horovitz's ''It's Called the Sugar Plum'', starring Clayburgh. Pacino won an [[Obie Award]] for Best Actor for his role, with [[John Cazale]] winning for Best Supporting actor and Horowitz for Best New Play.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Bregman]] saw the play and offered to be Pacino's manager, a partnership that became fruitful in the years to come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do ''The Godfather'', ''Serpico'' and ''Dog Day Afternoon''.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacino and this production of ''The Indian Wants the Bronx'' traveled to Italy for a performance at the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in [[Spoleto]]. It was Pacino's first journey to Italy; he later recalled that &quot;performing for an Italian audience was a marvelous experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt; Pacino and Clayburgh were cast in &quot;Deadly Circle of Violence&quot;, an episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[N.Y.P.D. (TV series)|N.Y.P.D.]]'', premiering November 12, 1968. Clayburgh at the time was also appearing on the soap opera ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', playing the role of Grace Bolton.

On February 25, 1969, Pacino made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in [[Don Petersen]]'s ''[[Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?]]'' at the [[Belasco Theater]] produced by [[A&amp;P]] Heir [[Huntington Hartford]].

== Film career ==

=== Early film career ===

Pacino found acting to be enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; After his success on stage, Pacino made his movie debut in 1969 with a brief screen appearance in ''[[Me, Natalie]]'', an independent film starring [[Patty Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt;

=== 1970s ===

[[File:Al Pacino and Robert Duvall in the Godfather.jpg|thumb|250px|With [[Robert Duvall]] in ''[[The Godfather]]''.]]
It was the 1971 film ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'', in which he played a [[heroin]] addict, that brought Pacino to the attention of director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast him as [[Michael Corleone]] in the blockbuster [[Mafia]] film ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). Although several established actors{{mdash}}including [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], and little-known [[Robert De Niro]]{{mdash}}also tried out for the part, Coppola selected the relatively unknown Pacino, much to the dismay of studio executives.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

Pacino was even teased on the set because of his short stature. Pacino's performance earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style, described by [[Halliwell's Film Guide]] as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;tightly clenched&quot;. Pacino boycotted the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Award ceremony]], as he was insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, noting that he had more screen time than costar and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] winner [[Marlon Brando]]{{mdash}}who also boycoted the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot;&gt;Grobel; p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, he co-starred in ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'', with [[Gene Hackman]], and won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. That same year Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in ''[[Serpico]]'', based on the true story of New York City policeman [[Frank Serpico]], who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot;/&gt; In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in the sequel ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which became the first sequel to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]]; Pacino, meanwhile, was nominated for his third Oscar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot;/&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' has described his performance in ''The Godfather Part II'' as &quot;arguably cinema's greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', based on the true story of bank robber [[John Wojtowicz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; It was directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], who had directed him in ''Serpico'' a few years earlier, and Pacino was again nominated for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot;&gt;Grobel; p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in ''[[Bobby Deerfield]]'', directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], and received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor – Drama for his portrayal of the title role, losing out to [[Richard Burton]], who won for ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]''. His next film was the courtroom drama ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'', which again saw Pacino lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot;/&gt; However he lost out that year to [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''—a role that Pacino had declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot;/&gt;

During the 1970s, Pacino had four Oscar nominations for Best Actor, for his performances in ''Serpico'', ''The Godfather Part II'', ''Dog Day Afternoon'', and ''...And Justice for All''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

=== 1980s ===

Pacino's career slumped in the early 1980s; his appearances in the controversial ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', a film which provoked protests from New York's [[gay]] community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-08-28/film/gay-old-time/ |title=Gay Old Time|last=Lee|first=Nathan|date=August 27, 2007|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=July 26, 2010 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the comedy-drama ''[[Author! Author! (film)|Author! Author!]]'' were critically panned.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; However, 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', directed by [[Brian De Palma]], proved to be a career highlight and a defining role.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to its violent content, but later received critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1859898,00.html|title=Scarface Nation|last=Snyder|first=S.

In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, ''[[The Local Stigmatic]]'', a 1969 [[Off Broadway]] play by the English writer [[Heathcote Williams]]. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was never released theatrically but was later released as part of the ''Pacino: An Actor's Vision'' box set in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

His 1985 film ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' about a fur trapper during the [[American Revolutionary War]], was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production,&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. During this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of ''Crystal Clear'', ''National Anthems'' and other plays; he appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1988 in producer [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: &quot;I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'' on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://franklovece.com/subpage.html#pacino |title= Pacino re-focuses on film career; after five-year absence, actor returns to the big screen |work=Los Angeles Times |date= September 17, 1989 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 | first=Frank | last=Lovece}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacino returned to film in 1989's ''[[Sea of Love (film)|Sea of Love]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; in which he portrayed a detective hunting a [[serial killer]] who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===

[[File:Al Pacino Cannes 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Al Pacino at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Pacino received an Academy Award nomination for playing [[Big Boy Caprice]] in the box office hit ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' in 1990, of which critic [[Roger Ebert]] described Pacino as &quot;the scene-stealer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900615/REVIEWS/6150301/1023 |title=Dick Tracy Review |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=June 15, 1990|author=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year he followed this up by a return to one of his most famous characters, Michael Corleone, in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; The film received mixed reviews, and had problems during pre-production due to script rewrites and the withdrawal of actors shortly before production.

In 1991, Pacino starred in ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1991 film)|Frankie and Johnny]]'' with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who co-starred with Pacino in ''Scarface''. Pacino portrays a recently paroled cook who begins a relationship with a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner he works in. It was adapted by [[Terrence McNally]] from his own Off-Broadway play ''[[Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune]]'' (1987), which featured [[Kenneth Welsh]] and [[Kathy Bates]]. The film received mixed reviews, although Pacino later said he enjoyed playing the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxvii&quot;&gt;Grobel; p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, &quot;Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04EED7123AF932A25753C1A967958260|title=Short-Order Cookery And Dreams of Love |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1991|author=Janet Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Pacino won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], for his portrayal of the [[blindness|blind]] U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade in [[Martin Brest]]'s ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; That year, he was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', making Pacino the [[List of actors nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year|first male actor ever]] to receive two acting nominations for two different movies in the same year, and to win for the lead role.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

Pacino starred alongside [[Sean Penn]] in the crime drama ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' in 1993, in which he portrayed a gangster who is released from prison with the help of his lawyer (Penn) and vows to go straight. Pacino starred in [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995), in which he and [[Robert De Niro]] appeared on-screen together for the first time (though both Pacino and De Niro starred in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', they did not share any scenes).&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

In 1996, Pacino starred in his theatrical docudrama ''[[Looking for Richard]]'', which is both a performance of selected scenes of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and a broader examination of Shakespeare's continuing role and relevance in [[popular culture]]. The cast brought together for the performance included [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Winona Ryder]]. Pacino played [[Devil|Satan]] in the supernatural thriller ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997) which co-starred [[Keanu Reeves]]. The film was a success at the box office, taking US$150 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilsadvocate.htm | title = The Devils Advocate Box Office | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = August 1, 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100911113127/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilsadvocate.htm| archivedate= September 11, 2010 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert wrote in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 'The satanic character is played by Pacino with relish bordering on glee.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Devil's Advocate Review | first = Roger | last = Ebert | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170302/1023 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = October 17, 1997 | accessdate = August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'' Pacino played mafia gangster &quot;[[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty]]&quot;, in the true story of undercover FBI agent [[Joseph D.

Pacino also starred as real life ''[[60 Minutes]]'' producer [[Lowell Bergman]] in the multi-Oscar nominated ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' opposite [[Russell Crowe]], before starring in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' in 1999.

Pacino has not received another nomination from the Academy since ''Scent of a Woman'', but won two Golden Globes since the year 2000, the first being the [[Cecil B.

Pacino turned down an offer to reprise his role as Michael Corleone in the computer game version of ''[[The Godfather: The Game|The Godfather]]''. As a result, [[Electronic Arts]] was not permitted to use Pacino's likeness or voice in the game, although his character does appear in it.

AFI is proud to present him with its 35th Life Achievement Award.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 2006, the [[University Philosophical Society]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] awarded Pacino the Honorary Patronage of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/news/news.php?headerID=476&amp;vs_date=November 1, 2006|title=Award Winning Actor, Al Pacino Visits Trinity College|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=Trinity College Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacino played a [[Satire|spoof role]] in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' alongside [[George Clooney]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Andy García]] as the villain Willy Bank, a casino tycoon targeted by Danny Ocean and his crew.

''[[88 Minutes]]'' was released on April 18, 2008 in the United States, having already been released in various other countries in 2007. The film co-starred [[Alicia Witt]] and was critically panned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/88_minutes/  |title=88 Minutes On Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although critics found the fault to be in the plot instead of Pacino's acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/88minutes|title=88 Minutes on Metacritic |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', Pacino and [[Robert De Niro]] co-star as New York detectives searching for a serial killer. The film was released to theaters on September 12, 2008. Although it was an anticipated return for the two stars, it was not well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/righteous-kill|title=Righteous Kill|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Lumenick]] of ''[[The New York Post]]'' gave ''Righteous Kill'' one star out of four, saying: &quot;Al Pacino and Robert De Niro collect bloated paychecks with intent to bore in ''Righteous Kill'', a slow-moving, ridiculous police thriller that would have been shipped straight to the remainder bin at [[Blockbuster Video|Blockbuster]] if it starred anyone else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09122008/entertainment/movies/al__bobs_frown_fest_128666.htm|title= Righteous Kill Review|work=[[New York Post]] |date= September 12, 2008|accessdate=October 30, 2010|first=Lou|last=Lumenick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malkovich then directed a Steppenwolf co-production, the 1984 revival of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''[[Balm in Gilead]]'', for which he received a second Obie Award and a [[Drama Desk Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;/&gt; His [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] debut that year was as Biff in ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' alongside [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy. Malkovich won an ''[[Emmy Award]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-malkovich |title=John Malkovich Emmy Nominated |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this role when the play was [[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|adapted for television]] by [[CBS]] in 1985.

One of the actor's first forays into film was as an extra alongside Allen, [[Terry Kinney]], [[George Wendt]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]] in [[Robert Altman]]'s 1978 film ''[[A Wedding]]''. He made his feature film debut in 1984 as [[Sally Field]]'s blind boarder Mr. Will in ''[[Places in the Heart]]''. For his portrayal of Mr. Will, Malkovich received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. He also portrayed [[Al Rockoff]] in ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]''. He continued to have steady work in films such as ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], and the 1987 film adaptation of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[The Glass Menagerie (1987 film)|The Glass Menagerie]]'' with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]]. A few years later, Malkovich became a star when he portrayed the sinister and sensual Valmont in the 1988 film ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'', a film adaptation of the stage play [[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (play) |''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'']] by [[Christopher Hampton]], who in turn had adapted it from the 1782 [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|novel]] of the same title by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]. He later reprised this role for the music video of &quot;[[Walking on Broken Glass]]&quot; by [[Annie Lennox]].

In 1990, he recited, in Croat, verses of the [[Croatia]]n [[national anthem]] ''[[Lijepa naša domovino]]'' (Our Beautiful Homeland) in [[Nenad Bach]]'s song &quot;Can We Go Higher?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/art.html#malkov Croatianhistory.net: John Malkovich] Retrieved August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Morten Faldaas

Malkovich starred in the 1992 [[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Steinbeck]]'s award-winning novella ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' as Lennie alongside [[Gary Sinise]] as George. In 1994, he was nominated for another Oscar, in the same category, for ''[[In the Line of Fire]]''. Though he played the title role in the [[Charlie Kaufman]]-penned ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', he played a slight variation of himself, as indicated by the character's middle name of &quot;Horatio&quot;. Malkovich has [[cameo appearance|a cameo]] in the movie ''[[Adaptation.]]''—also written by Kaufman—appearing as himself during the filming of ''Being John Malkovich''. ''[[The Dancer Upstairs (film)|The Dancer Upstairs]]'', Malkovich's directorial film debut, was released in 2002. Recent film roles include ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[Burn After Reading]]'', ''[[Changeling (2008 film)|Changeling]]'', ''RED'' and ''[[Secretariat (film)|Secretariat]]''.

Malkovich has hosted three episodes of the [[NBC]] sketch show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The first occasion was in January 1989 with musical guest [[Anita Baker]]; the second in October 1993 with musical guest [[Billy Joel]] (and special appearance by former cast member [[Jan Hooks]]); and the third was in December 2008 with musical guest [[T.I.]] with [[Swizz Beatz]] (and special appearances by [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Molly Sims]] and [[Jamie-Lynn Sigler]]).

In keeping with his renaissance-man image, he created his own fashion company, Mrs. Mudd, in 2002. The company released its John Malkovich menswear collection, &quot;Uncle Kimono,&quot; in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/john-malkovich-trunk-show |title=John Malkovich Trunk Show at The Royal Court Theatre |publisher=[[Royal Court Theatre]] |date=2005-04-30 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently covered in international press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Malkovich and Flipping Uncle Kimono|url=http://capitalpartners.filmannex.com/malkovich-partnership/|publisher=International Press Clippings|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and its second clothing line, &quot;Technobohemian,&quot; in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/elite_audience_XOywebe2MR68OHWgD8SzaJ |title=John Malkovich launches clothing line for wealthy guys |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkovich designed the outfits himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/john_malkovich_the_invisible_man/ |title=John Malkovich: The Invisible Man |publisher=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston Magazine]] |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:John Malkovich KVIFF Master Class.jpg|thumb|Interview at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], July 9, 2009]]
Malkovich was married to actress [[Glenne Headly]] from 1982 to 1988. They divorced after Malkovich became involved with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He later met his long-term partner Nicoletta Peyran on the set of ''[[The Sheltering Sky (film)|The Sheltering Sky]]'', where she was the second assistant director, in 1989. They have two children, Amandine and Loewy.&lt;ref name=GuardianMultitude /&gt;

Malkovich is fluent in French, and for nearly 10 years lived and worked in a theater in [[Southern France]]. He and his family left [[France]] in a dispute over taxes in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;barber&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last =Barber |first = Lynn| url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1816049,00.html|title=Life and taxes|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 7, 2006| accessdate = July 14, 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then he has lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Kahn| first =Joseph P. |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2005/09/12/seeking_john_malkovich/ | title=Seeking John Malkovich |date = September 12, 2005| accessdate=December 28, 2008| work=[[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Malkovich said he had just spent five weeks that summer living in France.

Malkovich lost millions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8601690.stm|title = Actor John Malkovich complains over Madoff fraud award|publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-04-03|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Madoff investment scandal|Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme]] when it collapsed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Thomas | last=Zambito | coauthors= Larry McShane |authorlink= | title=Sandy Koufax, John Malkovich among Bernie Madoff victims as court filings are released | date=February 5, 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/02/04/2009-02-04_sandy_koufax_john_malkovich_among_bernie.html | work =New York Daily News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malkovich stated in a 2011 interview that &quot;I’m not a political person actually, and I don’t have an ideology.&quot; He also said that he had not voted since [[George McGovern]] lost his presidential run in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=John Malkovich: 'I've read more books on the Middle East than any British journalist'|time=5:40|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/video/2011/jun/17/john-malkovich-middle-east-barbican|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However according to actor [[William Hootkins]], who worked with Malkovich in [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Rocket to the Moon (play)|Rocket to the Moon]]'', Malkovich is &quot;so right-wing you have to wonder if he's kidding.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Right for the part|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3592043/Right-for-the-part.html|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|date=2003-05-31|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in an interview with the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' whether it was necessary to have spiritual beliefs to portray a spiritual character, he said &quot;No, I'd say not...I'm an [[atheist]]. I wouldn't say I'm without spiritual belief particularly, or rather, specifically. Maybe I'm [[agnostic]], but I'm not quite sure there's some great creator somehow controlling everything and giving us free will. I don't know; it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Howell| first =Peter| url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/FilmFest/article/497033|title=A Kinder, Gentler Malkovich| work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2008-09-11| accessdate = 2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 appearance at the [[Cambridge Union Society]], when asked whom he would most like to &quot;fight to the death&quot;, Malkovich replied that he would &quot;rather just shoot&quot; journalist [[Robert Fisk]] and British [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[George Galloway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;outburst&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1967317.stm|title=MP stunned at actor's outburst|work=[[BBC Online]]|date=May 4, 2002 | accessdate = December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Fisk and Galloway reacted with outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Fisk| first =Robert| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-why-does-john-malkovich-want-to-kill-me-605849.html|title=Why Does Malkovich Want to Kill Me?|work=[[The Independent]]|date=May 14, 2002| accessdate = July 14, 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-condemn-me-but-get-your-facts-right-first-7547335.html?origin=internalSearch | title=Robert Fisk: Condemn me, but get your facts right first | work=The Independent | date=10 March 2012 | accessdate=April 29, 2012 | author=Fisk, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Selden Duvall''' (born January 5, 1931) is an American actor and director. He has won an [[Academy Award]], two [[Emmy|Emmy Awards]], four [[Golden Globe|Golden Globe Awards]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] over the course of his career.

A veteran actor, Duvall has starred in some of the most acclaimed and popular films and TV shows of all time, among them ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[Joe Kidd]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'', ''[[The Apostle]]'', ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'', ''[[The Conversation]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Falling Down]]'', ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' and ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]''.

He began appearing in [[theater]] during the late 1950s, moving into [[television]] and [[film]] roles during the early 1960s in such works as ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1962) (as [[Boo Radley]]) and ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963). He landed many of his most famous roles during the early 1970s with films like the blockbuster comedy ''MASH'' (1970) (as Major [[Frank Burns]]) and the lead in [[George Lucas]]' ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), as well as Duvall's own favorite, [[Horton Foote]]'s adaptation of [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Tomorrow (1972 film)|Tomorrow]] (1972), a project developed at [[Actors Studio|The Actors Studio]].&lt;ref name=baltimoresun1977&gt;{{cite news | title = Robert Duvall is Staying Put on Broadway | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1862426942.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+22%2C+1977&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&amp;desc=Robert+Duvall+is+staying+put+on+Broadway&amp;pqatl=google | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | date = February 22, 1977 | accessdate = December 9, 2012 (abstract)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of critically lauded performances in films which were also commercial successes.

Since then Duvall has continued to act in both film and television with such productions as ''Tender Mercies'' (1983) (for which he won an [[Academy Award]]), ''The Natural'' (1984), ''[[Colors (film)|''Colors'']]'' (1988), the television mini-series ''Lonesome Dove'' (1989), ''[[Stalin (1992 film)|Stalin]]'' (1992), ''[[The Man Who Captured Eichmann]]'' (1996), ''[[A Family Thing]]'' (1996), ''[[The Apostle]]'' (1997) (which he also wrote and directed), ''[[A Civil Action]]'' (1998), ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' (2003), ''[[Broken Trail]]'' (2006) and ''[[Get Low (film)|Get Low]]'' (2010).

==Early life==

Duvall was raised in the [[Christian Science]] religion and has stated that while it is his belief, he does not attend church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adherents.com/people/pd/Robert_Duvall.html | title = The Religious Affiliation of Robert Duvall | publisher = Adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up primarily on the East Coast, mainly in [[Annapolis, Maryland]],&lt;ref name=people1984&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert F. | last = Jones | title = Robert Duvall | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date = April 23, 1984 | accessdate = December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main hub of the [[US Navy]]. He recalled, &quot;I was a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Navy brat]]. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, made captain at 39 and retired as a rear admiral.&quot; He attended [[Severn School]] in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], and [[The Principia]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and graduated, in 1953, from [[Principia College]] in Elsah, Illinois. He served in the [[United States Army]] from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954, leaving as [[Private First Class]]. While stationed at Camp Gordon (later renamed Fort Gordon) in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedy &quot;[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]&quot; in nearby [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]&lt;ref name=people1977 /&gt; Duvall served two years in the [[US Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. He explained in 1984, &quot;That's led to some confusion in the press. Some stories have me shooting it out with the Commies from a foxhole over in Frozen Chosen. Pork Chop Hill stuff.

==Career==
===Early career in theatre, television and film: 1952–1969===
Duvall began his professional acting career with the [[Gateway Playhouse]], an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] summer theatre based in [[Bellport]], [[Long Island, New York]]. Arguably his stage debut was in its 1952 season when he played the Pilot in ''Laughter In The Stars'', an adaptation of ''[[The Little Prince]]'', at what was then the Gateway Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Program booklet for {{cite web | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1952_Playbill_LaughterInTheStars.pdf' | title = ''Laughter in the Stars'' | date = 1952, date n.a. | publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-year absence when he was with the [[U.S. Army]] (1953–1954), he returned to Gateway in its 1955 summer season, playing: Eddie Davis in [[Ronald Alexander]]'s ''Time Out For Ginger'' (July 1955), Hal Carter in [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic'' (July 1955), Charles Wilder in [[John Willard]]'s ''The Cat And The Canary'' (August 1955), Paris in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible'' (August 1955), and John the Witchboy in [[William Berney]] and [[Howard Richardson (playwright)|Howard Richardson]]'s ''Dark Of The Moon'' (September 1955). The playbill of ''Dark Of The Moon'' indicated that he had portrayed the Witch Boy before and that he will &quot;repeat his famous portrayal&quot; of this character for the 1955 season's revival of this play. For Gateway's 1956 season (his third season with the Gateway Players), he played the role of Max Halliday in [[Frederick Knott]]'s ''Dial M For Murder'' (July 1956), Virgil Blessing in Inge's ''Bus Stop'' (August 1956), and Clive Mortimer in [[John van Druten]]'s ''I Am A Camera'' (August 1956). The playbills for the 1956 season described him as &quot;an audience favorite&quot; in the last season and as having &quot;appeared at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and studied acting with Sandy Meisner this past winter.&quot;

In its 1957 season, he appeared as Mr. Mayher in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''Witness For The Prosecution'' (July 1957), as Hector in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Thieves' Carnival]]l'' (July 1957), and the role which he once described as the &quot;catalyst of his career&quot;:{{where?|date=December 2012}} Eddie Carbone in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''A View from the Bridge'' (from July 30 to August 3, 1957, and directed by [[Ulu Grosbard]] who was by then a regular director at the Gateway Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1955/1956/1957. Retrieved January 2–3, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself attended one of Duvall's performances as Eddie and also during this performance he met important people that allowed him to, in two months, land a &quot;spectacular lead&quot; in the ''Naked City'' television series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, he was also appearing at the [[Augusta Civic Theatre]], the [[McLean Theatre]] in [[Virginia]] and the [[Arena Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The 1957 playbills also described him as &quot;a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse&quot; (so he must have completed his studies there by the Summer of 1957), &quot;a member of Sanford Meisner's professional Workshop&quot; and as having worked with [[Alvin Epstein]], a [[mime]] and a member of [[Marcel Marceau]]'s Company. By this time also (July 1957) his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy in ''The Rainmaker'' and as Harvey Weems in [[Horton Foote]]'s ''The Midnight Caller''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playbill_ThievesCarnival 1957&quot;&gt;Duvall biography at program booklet for {{cite web |title = ''Thieves' Carnival'' | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957/1957_Playbill_ThievesCarnival.pdf | date = July 23–27, 1957| publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution 1957&quot;&gt;1957_Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution.pdf at gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957. Retrieved January 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Already receiving top-billing at the Gateway Playhouse, in the 1959 season he appeared in lead roles as Stanley Kowalski in [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''Streetcar Named Desire'' (July–August 1959), Maxwell Archer in ''Once More With Feeling'', Igor Romanoff in [[Peter Ustinov]]'s ''Romanoff and Juliet'', and Joe Mancuso in [[Kyle Crichton]]'s ''The Happiest Millionaire'' (all in August 1959).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1959.

In 1959, Duvall made his first [[television]] appearance on ''[[Armstrong Circle Theater]]'' in the episode ''The Jailbreak''.

Foote, who would collaborate with Duvall many more times over the course of their careers, said he believed Duvall had a particular love of common people and ability to infuse fascinating revelations into his roles. Foote has described Duvall as &quot;our number one actor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miracles&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people = [[Bruce Beresford]] (actor), Robert Duvall (actor), [[Horton Foote]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director), [[Tess Harper]] (actress) |date = 2002-04-16 |title = Miracles &amp; Mercies |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium = Documentary |publisher = [[Blue Underground]] |location = [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]] |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s. He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of Major [[Frank Burns]] in the film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' and for his portrayal of the title role in the [[cult classic]] ''[[THX 1138]]'' in 1971. His first major critical success came portraying [[Tom Hagen]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974). The former film earned him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. In 1976 Duvall played supporting roles in ''[[The Eagle Has Landed]]'' and as Dr. Watson in ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' opposite [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Laurence Olivier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0075194|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a [[BAFTA Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). His line &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; from ''Apocalypse Now'' is regarded as [[cultural icon|iconic]] in [[film|cinema]] history. The full text is as follows:

{{Bquote|You smell that? Do you smell that? [[Napalm]], son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know - that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...}}

Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'' (1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] in ''[[The Great Santini]]'' (1979) as the hard-boiled [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] LtCol. &quot;Bull&quot; Meechum. The latter role was loosely based on a Marine [[Naval aviator (United States)|aviator]], Colonel [[Donald Conroy]], the father of the book's author [[Pat Conroy]]. He also portrayed United States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the [[miniseries|television miniseries]] ''[[Ike (TV miniseries)|Ike]]'' (1979).

In 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole in [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]''. For his performance he received a [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play|Outstanding Actor in a Play]].

Duvall continued to appear in films during the 1980s, including the roles of cynical sportswriter Max Mercy in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' (1988). He won an Oscar for [[Academy award for best actor|Best Actor]] as [[country music|country western singer]] Mac Sledge in ''[[Tender Mercies]]'' (1983). Duvall was said{{by whom|date=December 2012}} to have written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few &quot;background, secondary songs.&quot; Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, &quot;What's the point if you're not going to do your own [singing]? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miracles&quot; /&gt;

Actress [[Tess Harper]], who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director [[Bruce Beresford]], too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, &quot;Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miracles&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miracles&quot; /&gt;

In 1989, Duvall appeared in the miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'' in the role of [[Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae]]. He has stated in several forums,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} including ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'',{{date?}} that this particular role was his personal favorite. He won a Golden Globe Award and earned an ''[[Emmy Award]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/robert-duvall Robert Duvall Emmy Award Winner]&lt;/ref&gt; nomination. For his role as a former Texas Ranger peace officer, Duvall was trained in the use of Walker revolvers by the Texas [[marksman]] [[Joe Bowman (marksman)|Joe Bowman]].

'''Kenneth McMillan''' (July 2, 1932 – January 8, 1989) was an American actor.  McMillan was usually cast as gruff, hostile and unfriendly characters due to his rough image. However, he was cast in some lighter roles that highlighted his more benign side.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
McMillan was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Margaret and Harry McMillan, a truck driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/62/Kenneth-McMillan.html Kenneth McMillan Biography (1932-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prior to becoming an actor, McMillan was employed at [[Gimbels| Gimbels Department Store]] first as a salesman, then as a section manager, and then a floor superintendent managing three floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Kenneth McMillan, 56, Actor In Numerous Stage and Film Roles|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/obituaries/kenneth-mcmillan-56-actor-in-numerous-stage-and-film-roles.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 10, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 30 McMillan decided to pursue an acting career. He attended the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts]] and took acting lessons from [[Uta Hagen]] and [[Irene Dailey]]. He was married to Kathryn McDonald (20 June 1969 - 8 January 1989) (his death) with whom he had one child, actress Alison McMillan.

===Career===
&lt;!--- Note: Much of this text matches the text on McMillan's IMDB page ---&gt;
McMillan made his film debut at age 41 with a small role in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s police drama ''[[Serpico]]''. The actor played a borough commander in ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'', but often was cast as characters such as a cowardly small town sheriff in [[Tobe Hooper]]'s 1979 TV mini-series ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'', a similar law enforcement officer in the 1987 [[Burt Reynolds]] film ''[[Malone (1987 film)|Malone]]'', [[William Hurt]]'s bitter paraplegic father in ''[[Eyewitness (1981 film)|Eyewitness]]'', a wily safe cracker in ''[[The Pope of Greenwich Village]]'' and a racist fire chief in ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' who is memorably told off by the New York police commissioner, [[James Cagney]].

He portrayed the vile and grotesquely obese [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] in ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', the pathetic drunken pop of [[Aidan Quinn]] in ''[[Reckless (1984 film)|Reckless]]'' and a sleazy high roller gambler in &quot;[[The Ledge]],&quot; an episode of the horror anthology film ''[[Cat's Eye (1985 film)|Cat's Eye]]''. Yet he did sometimes end up on the right side of the law, playing [[Robert Duvall]]'s detective partner in ''[[True Confessions]]'' and a judge who must rule whether [[Richard Dreyfuss]] has the right to die in ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]''.

McMillan was also adept at comedy, giving performances as a baseball club manager in ''[[Blue Skies Again]]'', [[Meg Ryan]]'s corrupt security guard captain dad in ''[[Armed and Dangerous (film)|Armed and Dangerous]]'' and a dotty senile veterinarian in ''[[Three Fugitives]]''.

McMillan had a recurring role as [[Valerie Harper]]'s irate boss Jack Doyle on the TV sitcom &quot;[[Rhoda]].&quot; Among the TV shows McMillan did guest spots on are ''[[Dark Shadows]],'' ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'', as a 53rd precinct lieutenant on ''[[Kojak]]'', ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''. 

Outside of his film and TV credits, McMillan also frequently performed on stage at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. He acted in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Streamers]]'' and ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]''. He won an [[Obie Award|Obie]] for his performance in the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''Weekends Like Other People''.

McMillan died of [[liver disease]] at age 56.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/obituaries/kenneth-mcmillan-56-actor-in-numerous-stage-and-film-roles.html Kenneth McMillan, 56, Actor In Numerous Stage and Film Roles]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diana Sands''' (August 22, 1934{{spaced ndash}}September 21, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] dramatic actress, perhaps most famous for her portrayal of Beneatha Younger, the sister of [[Sidney Poitier]]'s character in the original stage and film versions of [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961). She also appeared in a number of dramatic television series in the sixties and seventies such as ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', as Davala Unawa in the 1967 ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' episode &quot;Dossier on a Diplomat&quot;, Dr. Harrison in the ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|Outer Limits]]'' episode &quot;[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]&quot;, and ''[[Julia (TV series)|Julia]]''. 

A member of the Actors Studio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of the Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=280|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sands' performance in the Studio's 1964 production of [[James Baldwin]]'s [[Blues for Mr. Charlie]] was a highlight of that show, and one which would be sorely missed during its subsequent London engagement when Sands had already committed to co-starring with [[Alan Alda]] in the original [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production of ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' (1964) for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David|last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of the Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=241|chapter=Venture Into Production: The Actors Studio Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sands was culled eight years later to provide a track for the Original New York Cast album of [[Free to Be... You and Me]]. Unfortunately, she had died by the time the [[ABC-TV|ABC]] [[ABC Afterschool Special|Afterschool Special]] had begun production and her previously recorded vocal track was not selected for inclusion.

In 1970, '''Diana Sands''' co-starred in the [[Norman Jewison]] produced film, ''[[The Landlord]]'', directed by [[Hal Ashby]] and starring [[Beau Bridges]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Susan Anspach]], [[Robert Klein]], [[Trish Van Devere]], [[Hector Elizondo]], [[Lou Gossett Jr.]], and [[Pearl Bailey]]. 

In his memoirs, [[Bob Dylan]] tells of meeting Ms. Sands at a party and states that she was, &quot;an electrifying actress who I might have been secretly in love with...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Bob|title=Chronicles:Volume One|year=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster, Inc|location=New York, New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was set to star in the film ''[[Claudine (film)|Claudine]]'' (1974) with [[James Earl Jones]], however, she was too ill to accept the role and it went to her friend [[Diahann Carroll]]. She was twice nominated for a [[Tony Award]], and twice nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] as well. 

She died of [[leiomyosarcoma]] at aged 39.

==Career==
[[Image:Ruby Dee.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruby Dee by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]
Dee made several appearances on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] before receiving national recognition for her role in the 1950 film ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''. Her career in acting has crossed all major forms of media over a span of eight decades, including the films ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', in which she recreated her stage role as a suffering housewife in the projects, and ''[[Edge of the City]]''. She played both roles opposite [[Sidney Poitier]]. During the 1960s, Dee appeared in such politically charged films as ''Gone Are the Days'' and ''[[The Incident (1967 film)|The Incident]]'', which is recognized as helping pave the way for young [[African-American]] actors and [[filmmakers]]. 

Among the many appearances that she made in various television series is her role as Cora Sanders, a Marxist college professor, in the Season 1 / Episode 14 of ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', entitled “Target Black” which aired on Friday night, January 3, 1975. The character of Cora Sanders was obviously, but loosely, influenced by the real-life [[Angela Y. Davis]].

She appeared in one episode of ''[[The Golden Girls]]''' sixth season. Dee has been nominated for eight [[Emmy Awards]], winning once for her role in the 1990 [[Television movie|TV film]] ''[[Decoration Day (film)|Decoration Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ruby Dee Awards| url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002039/awards | work=The Internet Movie Database| year=2008 | accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for her television guest appearance in the ''[[China Beach]]'' episode, &quot;Skylark&quot;. Her husband [[Ossie Davis]] (1917–2005) also appeared in that episode. In 1995, she and her husband were awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#95 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also recipients of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2004.

In 2003, she narrated a series of WPA [[slave narratives]] in the HBO film ''Unchained Memories''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343129/ IMDb.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the winner of the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] was tied between Dee and Ossie Davis for ''With Ossie And Ruby: In This Life Together'', and former President [[Jimmy Carter]].

She was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in 2007 for her portrayal of Mama Lucas in ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]''. She won the Screen Actors Guild award for the same performance. At 83 years of age, Dee is currently the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees|second oldest nominee for Best Supporting Actress]], behind [[Gloria Stuart]] who was 87 when nominated for her role in ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. This was Dee's first nomination.

On February 12, 2009, Dee joined the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College orchestra and chorus, along with the Riverside Inspirational Choir and NYC Labor Choir, in honoring Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday at the Riverside Church in [[New York City]]. Under the direction of [[Maurice Peress]], they performed [[Earl Robinson]]'s ''The Lonesome Train: A Music Legend for Actors, Folk Singers, Choirs, and Orchestra'', in which Dee was the Narrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theriversidechurchny.org/news/article.php?id=270 Theriversdechurchny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and activism==
Ruby Wallace married blues singer Frankie Dee in the mid-1940s but later divorced him. Three years later she married actor [[Ossie Davis]]. Together, Dee and Davis wrote an autobiography in which they discussed their political activism as well as insights on their [[open marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/quotes/a/ossierubyopen.htm|title=Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee on Open Marriage|work=About.com|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had three children: son, [[blues]] musician [[Guy Davis (Blues musician)|Guy Davis]], and two daughters, Nora Day and Hasna Muhammad. Dee has survived [[breast cancer]] for more than 30 years. Dee and Davis were well-known [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] activists. Among others, Dee is a member of [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), the [[NAACP]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. Dee and Davis were both personal friends of both [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]], with Davis giving the [[eulogy]] at Malcolm X's funeral in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malcolmx.com/about/eulogy.html |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's Eulogy |accessdate=September&amp;nbsp;6, 2009|publisher=The Official Website of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |last=Davis |first=Ossie |authorlink=Ossie Davis |date=February&amp;nbsp;27, 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005 Dee was awarded - along with her late husband - the Lifetime Achievement Freedom Award, presented by the National Civil Rights Museum located in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. Dee, a long-time resident of [[New Rochelle, New York]], was inducted into the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Women's Hall of Fame on March 30, 2007, joining such other honorees as [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and [[Nita Lowey]].&lt;ref name=wc&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writers|title=Ruby Dee To Be Named To Women's Hall Of Fame|url=http://westchester.com/Westchester_News/Westchester_Community_News/Ruby_Dee_To_Be_Named_To_Women's_Hall_Of_Fame_200703067510.html|work=Westchester.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506081112/http://westchester.com/Westchester_News/Westchester_Community_News/Ruby_Dee_To_Be_Named_To_Women%27s_Hall_Of_Fame_200703067510.html|date=2007-03-06|archivedate=2007-03-06|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she received an Honorary Degree from [[Princeton University]].

Washington was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], near New York City, New York, on December 28, 1954. His mother, Lennis &quot;Lynne&quot;, was a beauty parlor-owner and operator born in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and partly raised in [[Harlem]]. His father, Reverend Denzel Hayes Washington, Sr., a native of [[Buckingham County, Virginia]], served as an ordained [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] minister, and also worked for the Water Department and at a local department store, S. Klein.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickson|first=Chris|authorlink=Chris Nickson|title=Denzel Washington|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|year=1996|location=New York|pages=9–11|isbn = 0-312-96043-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/90/Denzel-Washington.html |title=Denzel Washington Biography (1954–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gniaid&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ingram|first=E.

Washington attended grammar school at [[Pennington-Grimes Elementary School]] in Mount Vernon until 1968. When he was 14, his parents' marriage fell apart and his mother sent him to a private preparatory school, [[Oakland Military Academy]], in [[New Windsor, New York]]. &quot;That decision changed my life,&quot; Washington later said, &quot;because I wouldn't have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Denzel Washington: 'I Try To Send A Good Message' | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = December 12, 1999 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1999/edition_12-12-1999/Denzel_Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Oakland, Washington next attended [[Mainland High School]], a public high school in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], from 1970 to 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;/&gt; Washington was interested in attending [[Texas Tech University]]: &quot;I grew up in the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Club]] in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders.

He participated in a staff talent show for the campers and a colleague suggested he try acting.&lt;ref&gt;Paisner, Daniel [http://books.google.com/books?id=ILdSeSY8FSQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=denzel+washington+camp+sloane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rculdd89ou&amp;sig=Qg_tzw6Caz7wHmgaxxAofQVNqIA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f5ueS9bgNpS0tgf2ysyGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''A Hand to Guide Me''] (Meredith Books, 2006), p. 17.

Returning to Fordham that fall with a renewed purpose and focus, he enrolled at the Lincoln Center campus to study acting and was given the title roles in both Eugene O'Neill's ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]''. Upon graduation he attended graduate school at the [[American Conservatory Theatre]] in San Francisco, where he stayed for one year before returning to New York to begin a professional acting career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll Denzel Washington Biography], AllMovie.com. accessdate=February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A major career break came when he starred as Dr. Phillip Chandler in the television hospital drama ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' which ran from 1982 to 1988 on [[NBC]]. He was one of only a few African American actors to appear on the series for its entire six-year run. Washington also appeared in several television, film and stage roles such as the films ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984), ''[[The George McKenna Story|Hard Lessons]]'' (1986) and ''[[Power (1986 film)|Power]]'' (1986).

He won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in his next film, the 2001 cop thriller ''[[Training Day]]'' as Detective Alonzo Harris, a rogue and evil Los Angeles cop with questionable law-enforcement tactics. Washington was the second African-American performer to win an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], the first being [[Sidney Poitier]] who happened to receive an [[Honorary Academy Award]] the same night that Washington won. Washington holds the record (six so far) for most Oscar nominations and most wins (two so far) by an actor or actress of African descent.

After appearing in 2002's box office success, the health care-themed ''[[John Q.]]'', Washington directed his first film, a well-reviewed drama called ''[[Antwone Fisher (film)|Antwone Fisher]]'', in which he also co-starred.

In 2006, Denzel worked alongside multi-talented Irish off-rock band the Script on their new project combining music and Hollywood. The hybrid of genres was critically acclaimed but didn't receive much mainstream attention due to a legal conflicts between the Script's record label and Denzel's studio commitments.

In 2007, he co-starred with [[Russell Crowe]], for the second time after ''[[Virtuosity]]'' in 1995, in ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4934">{{Nihongo|'''Teiji Ito'''|伊藤貞司|Itō Teiji|extra=January 22, 1935 – August 16, 1982}} was a Japanese composer and performer.  He is best known for his scores for the avant-garde films by [[Maya Deren]].

==Biography==
Ito was born in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] into a theatrical family. His father, Yuji Itō, was a composer and costume designer, and his mother, Teiko Ono, was a dancer who worked in both traditional and classical genres. Ito moved with his family to [[New York]] at the age of six. In 1952, at the age of seventeen, he began composing music for the films of Maya Deren. He traveled with her to [[Haiti]] in 1955, learning ceremonial and secular drumming techniques from the Haitian musician [[Coyote]].

Ito had a long and productive career, composing music for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Hollywood]], drama, and dance.  His works feature an innovative combination of sounds and often utilize musical instruments from many world cultures, which he played himself. His music is not as well known as that of many of his contemporaries because few recordings of his music were available until the late 20th century.  

In 1961, he composed a score for a New York production of [[Alfred Jarry]]'s ''[[Ubu Roi|King Ubu]]'' by [[The Living Theatre]], which was released on CD by [[Tzadik Records]] in 1998. He won an [[Obie Award]] for his theater music in the 1960-61 season. Ito composed music for dancer [[Jean Erdman]]'s musical play ''[[Jean Erdman#The Coach with the Six Insides|The Coach With the Six Insides]]'' (1962). He composed the score for the original Broadway production of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1963) by [[Dale Wasserman]].

Ito was married four times. He married Maya Deren in the late 1950s. With his second wife Gail Ryan, he had a daughter, Tavia. His third wife was a photographer named Ilene who also played instruments on a number of his recordings, and his fourth marriage was to Cherel Winett (1947–1999). Ito and Winett edited Deren's Haiti footage (1947–1954) into the [[documentary film]] ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]'' (1985).

He died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while visiting Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B12F6345D0C728EDDA10894DA484D81 &quot;Teiji Ito, 47, Composer For Theater and Dance&quot;. NY Times obituary, (August 21, 1982]). Retrieved on August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Teiji Ito Collection, consisting of audio tapes, is held by the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound at the [[New York Public Library]] for the Performing Arts in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/rha/ito.xml &quot;Teiji Ito Collection, 1963-1982&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese American]] actor [[Jerry Ito]] (1927–2007) was Teiji Ito's first cousin.
